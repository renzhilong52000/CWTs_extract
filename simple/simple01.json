Waring blender jar. The blender jar was then placed on the blending apparatus and the speed was set so that a vortex of about 1″ depth was formed. The additives were then measured and adding in the following order: bactericides, chelating agent, salts, and buffer agents. The mixture was mixed for 10 minutes and then the blender was turned off. A 1000 ml Buchner funnel having a 2.7 μ filter paper in the sidearm vacuum flask was then inserted. Using a vacuum hose, the sidearm vacuum flask was then attached to either a vacuum pump of a faucet aspirator. The brine water was then filtered through the Buchner funnel using the vacuum pump. The vacuum pump was turned off after all of the brine mixture passed through the filter paper. The filtered brine mixture was then poured into a clean 40 oz Waring blender jar. The blender was set at a speed such that a vortex of about 1″ was formed. The desired amount of the gelling agent was then added to the brine mixture and the fluid was mixed for 30 minutes at room temperature to form a viscosified treatment fluid. The gel temperature, pH, and viscosity were then measured and recorded. The blender jar was then sealed and the viscosified treatment fluid was sheared for about 2 minutes at a high rpm using an electric powerstate preset at 110% connected to the Waring Blender. The resultant sheared gel was then filtered through a 10 μ Whatman filter paper using a filter press system. The filtered gel was then collected. Any surfactant and breakers were then added., 86204\u003dScale inhibitors may be added to the viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention, for example, when a viscosified treatment fluid of the present invention is not particularly compatible with the formation waters in the formation in which it is being used. Any scale inhibitor that is compatible with the viscosified treatment fluid in which it will be used in suitable for use in the present invention. An example of a preferred scale inhibitor is “LP55?? from Halliburton Energy Services in Duncan, Okla. Another example of a preferred scale inhibitor is “FDP-S660-02?? available from Halliburton Energy Services in Duncan, Okla. If used, a scale inhibitor should be included in an amount effective to inhibit scale formation. Suitable amounts of scale inhibitors to include in the viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention may range from about 0.05 to 10 gallons per about 1000 gallons of the viscosified treatment fluid, more preferably from about 0.1 to 2 gallons per about 1000 gallons of the viscosified treatment fluid., 85276\u003dIf in a particular application a chosen viscosified treatment fluid is experiencing a viscosity degradation a stabilizer might be useful and can be included in the fluid. One example of a situation where a stabilizer might be beneficial is where the BHT of the well bore is sufficient by itself to break the viscosified treatment fluid with the use of a breaker. Suitable stabilizers include, but are not limited to, sodium thiosulfate. Such stabilizers may be useful when the viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention are utilized in a subterranean formation having a temperature above about 150? F. If included, a stabilizer may be added in an amount of from about 1 lb to about 50 lb per 1000 gal of viscosified treatment fluid. In other embodiments, a stabilizer may be included in an amount of from about 5 to about 20 lb per 1000 gal of viscosified treatment fluid., 82429\u003dOptionally, a viscosified treatment fluid of the present invention may contain an activator or a retarder, inter alia, to optimize the break rate provided by the breaker. Any known activator or retarder that is compatible with the particular breaker used is suitable for use in the present invention. Examples of such suitable activators include, but are not limited to, acid generating materials, chelated iron, copper, cobalt, and reducing sugars. Examples of suitable retarders include sodium thiosulfate and diethylene triamine. In some embodiments, the sodium thiosulfate may be used in a range of from about 1 to about 100 lbs. per 1000 gallons of viscosified treatment fluid. A preferred range may be from about 5 to about 20 lbs per 1000 gallons. An artisan of ordinary skill with the benefit of this disclosure will be able to identify a suitable activator or retarder and the proper concentration of such activator or retarder for a given application., 79926\u003dThe viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention also may comprise breakers capable of reducing the viscosity of the viscosified treatment fluid at a desired time. Examples of such suitable breakers for viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention include, but are not limited to, sodium chlorites, hypochlorites, perborate, persulfates, peroxides, including organic peroxides. Other suitable breakers include, but are not limited to, suitable acids and peroxide breakers, as well as enzymes that may be effective in breaking xanthan. Preferred examples of peroxide breakers include tert-butyl hydroperoxide and tert-amyl hydroperoxide. A breaker may be included in a viscosified treatment fluid of the present invention in an amount and form sufficient to achieve the desired viscosity reduction at a desired time. The breaker may be formulated to provide a delayed break, if desired. For example, a suitable breaker may be encapsulated if desired. Suitable encapsulation methods are known to those skilled in the art. One suitable encapsulation method that may be used involves coating the chosen breakers with a material that will degrade when downhole so as to release the breaker when desired. Resins that may be suitable include, but are not limited to, polymeric materials that will degrade when downhole. The terms “degrade,?? “degradation,?? or “degradable?? refer to both the two relatively extreme cases of hydrolytic degradation that the degradable material may undergo, i.e., heterogeneous (or bulk erosion) and homogeneous (or surface erosion), and any stage of degradation in between these two. This degradation can be a result of, inter alia, a chemical or thermal reaction or a reaction induced by radiation. Suitable examples include, but are not limited to, polysaccharides such as dextran or cellulose; chitins; chitosans; proteins; aliphatic polyesters; poly(lactides); poly(glycolides); poly(ε-caprolactones); poly(hydroxybutyrates); poly(anhydrides); aliphatic polycarbonates; orthoesters, poly(orthoesters); poly(amino acids); poly(ethylene oxides); and polyphosphazenes. If used, a breaker should be included in a composition of the present invention in an amount sufficient to facilitate the desired reduction in viscosity in a viscosified treatment fluid. For instance, peroxide concentrations that may be used vary from about 0.05 to about 30 gallons of peroxide per 1000 gallons of the viscosified treatment fluid., 83435\u003dThe viscosified treatment fluids of the present invention also may comprise suitable fluid loss control agents. Such fluid loss control agents may be particularly useful when a viscosified treatment fluid of the present invention is being used in a fracturing operation. This may be due in part to xanthan\u0027s potential to leak off into formation. Any fluid loss agent that is compatible with the viscosified treatment fluid is suitable for use in the present invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, starches, silica flour, and diesel dispersed in fluid. Another example of a suitable fluid loss control additive is one that comprises a degradable material. Suitable degradable materials include degradable polymers. Specific examples of suitable polymers include polysaccharides such as dextran or cellulose; chitins; chitosans; proteins; aliphatic polyesters; poly(lactides); poly(glycolides); poly(glycolide-co-lactides); poly(p-caprolactones); poly(3-hydroxybutyrates); poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerates); poly(anhydrides); aliphatic poly(carbonates); poly(orthoesters); poly(amino acids); poly(ethylene oxides); poly(phosphazenes); derivatives thereof; or combinations thereof. If included, a fluid loss additive should be added to a viscosified treatment fluid of the present invention in an amount of about 5 to about 50 pounds per 1000 gallons of the viscosified treatment fluid. In certain preferred embodiments, the fluid loss additive may be included in an amount from about 15 to about 30 pounds per 1000 gallons of the viscosified treatment fluid. For some liquid additives like diesel, these may be included in an amount from about 1% to about 20% by volume; in some preferred embodiments, these may be included in an amount from about 3% to about 10% by volume.}","textBeforeTable":"Referenced by Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as defined by the appended claims. As can be seen from the preceding examples, both the formation of and then the breaking of the viscosity of a viscosified treatment fluid comprising a gelling agent that comprises clarified xanthan can be controlled. To prepare these samples, 882 ml of seawater was added to a 40 oz. Waring blender jar. The blender jar was then placed on the blending apparatus and the speed was set so that a vortex of about 1″ depth was formed. The additives were then measured and adding in the following order: bactericides, chelating agent, salts, and buffer agents. The mixture was mixed for 10 minutes and then the blender was turned off. A 1000 ml Buchner funnel having a 2.7 μ filter paper in the sidearm vacuum flask was then inserted. Using a vacuum hose, the sidearm vacuum flask was then attached to either a vacuum pump of a faucet aspirator. The brine water was then filtered through the Buchner funnel using the vacuum pump. The vacuum pump was turned off after all","textAfterTable":"* Cited by examiner Classifications U.S. Classification 507/213 International Classification E21B, C09K8/68, C09K8/08, C09K8/60, C09K8/66 Cooperative Classification C09K8/08, C09K8/68 European Classification C09K8/08, C09K8/68 Legal Events Date Code Event Description Jul 13, 2004 AS Assignment Owner name: HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES, INC., TEXAS Free format text: ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNORS INTEREST;ASSIGNORS:MILSON, SHANE L.;PAULS, RICHARD;REEL/FRAME:015577/0500;SIGNING DATES FROM 20030701 TO 20030712 Feb 14, 2005 AS Assignment Owner name: HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES, INC., TEXAS Free format text: CORRECTIVE CHANGE OF NAME TO CORRECT THE YEAR OF EXECUTION.

acquisition device 134 preferably operates by setting the effective collection image frame rate based on the input from the image frame controller 136, and then automatically acquiring interrogation frames 154 during dead times. The interrogation frames 154 are preferably acquired at the fastest rate possible to maximize usage of the dead time. The number of interrogation frames 154 that can be acquired in the dead time depends upon its resolution (i.e., scan line density). The 4:1 ratio example of FIGS. 7A and 7B provides an acceptable compromise between resolution and number of interrogation frame samples 154 obtainable during the dead times. However, other resolutions are within the scope of the invention. For example, a 2:1 ratio would be feasible, and would constitute a significant difference in resolution. If the interrogation frame 154 has a scan line density similar to a full-resolution image 152, system performance would be degraded because the number of interrogation frames 154 that can be acquired during the “dead time?? would be very low (such as one or so), and thus very little sampling would occur during the dead time. This would cause a delay in any frame rate change, resulting in either loss of important image data or collection of unnecessary image data. However, other advantages are possible if the resolutions of the two types of image frames are similar, as discussed immediately below., 29851\u003dThis application is also related to application Ser.

It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The inventions set forth above may also be applied to medical imaging systems other than ultrasound which acquire full motion image data of moving anatomic structures. For example, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized axial tomography (CAT), positron emission tomography (PET), and the like acquire discrete scan lines of imaging data for reconstruction into a full-frame image of the body parts. These scan lines may be packaged into image loops. Likewise, the frame rates of the image frames may be adjusted using any of the techniques described above to reduce the amount of acquired data, without compromising image quality. Furthermore, the image frames acquired by such systems may be filtered across physiologic cycles, instead of temporally, to reduce image artefacts. The pseudo real-time transmission scheme is equally effective in transmitting and remotely viewing other types of non-image-related periodic physiological data, such as EKG waves.

The United States and the United Kingdom held predominantly equity securities, while Japan held predominantly debt securities., 7701\u003dThe IMF has changed the way it measures its liquidity to provide a clearer idea of its capacity to make new nonconcessional loans. The new measure, known as the one-year forward commitment capacity (FCC), gives policymakers and analysts for the first time a concrete figure of resources available―in dollars rather than the percentage points used previously. The IMF said that the FCC, which replaces the traditional liquidity ratio as the primary measure of the IMF\u0027s liquidity, increases the transparency of its finances. At the end of 2002, the IMF had $74 billion available using this measure.

No. 3,291,128 issued to J.G. O\u0027Neill, dated Dec. 13, 1966, to remedy this problem of air entrapment by providing a very flexible, soft piston head, moved along fine grooves or ridges extending the full length of the barrel. The soft material of the piston head enters and seal the grooves or passages between ridges. Entrapped air is released by twisting the head circumferentially of the barrel. This design has not proved wholly satisfactory in practice for two reasons. Firstly, due to the required softness of the piston head, parts of the piston head sealing the grooves or passages are pushed out of the grooves when pressure is applied to the head to discharge fluid by advancing the head in the barrel. This condition allows the fluid in the barrel to leak backward out throught the long grooves or passages. Secondly, when the head is rotationally twisted, air and fluid both flow rearwardly through the grooves or passages and the fluid undesirably leaks out of the barrel.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations It should be understood that the foregoing relates to only a limited number of embodiments of the invention which have been by way of examples only, and that it is intended to cover all changes and modifications of the examples of the invention herein chosen for the purpose of the disclosure, which do not constitute departures from the spirit and scope of the invention.

After the read security level, RSL is read from the storage area define information, step 901 checks the most-significant bit or the fourth bit of the security level data to determine whether the bit is \"0\" (enterprise key required) or \"1\" (enterprise key not required). If the bit is \"0\", step 902 checks whether or not the enterprise key has already been inputted. If the key has not been inputted, an error is notified in step 903; therwise, step 904 is effected to check the security level. If the most-significant bit of the security level data is found to have been defined as \"1\" in step 901, step 902 is skipped and step 904 is executed. In steps 904, 906, 908, 912, 915, and 917, three low-order bits of the security level data are checked to determine a security level at which the storage area is defined. First, the security level is checked against \"001\" in step 904. In the foregoing example, the value 001 is defined to require only a personal key.

In dynasty days, only the emperor was allowed to wear clothes with dragon designs. In Eastern philosophy, the dragon is said to be a deliverer of good fortune and a master of authority. The dragon is the only sign that is a legendary C and not a real - animal. In Chinese culture, the dragon is regarded as a divine beast, which is quite the reverse of the malicious monster that is often portrayed in Western literature.

The festival traditionally begins on the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar and ends on the 15th of the lunar calendar.

The predominant colour for Chinese New Year’s decoration is red. Red paper cut-outs and couplets written on red paper devoted to the popular themes of ‘happiness’, ‘wealth’, and ‘longevity’ are used to decorate windows and doors. Children wear brand new clothes on this day and receive money in red envelopes, known as 红包 (hóng b??o), from their parents and grandparents.

It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. Further, when the source pad is formed from the same material as the source electrode, the contact resistance problem caused when the source pad is in contact with the source electrode can be solved. In addition, since the pixel electrode is formed after forming the passivation layer, processing errors resulting in the pixel electrode contacting the source and drain can be prevented. According to the present invention as described above, the manufacture of the TFT of the liquid crystal display device can be accomplished using five mask steps (step of forming the gate, step of forming the active layer, step of forming the source and drain, step of etching the passivation layer and gate insulating film, and step of forming the pixel electrode), while the conventional process requires six or more mask steps. Thus, manufacturing cost can be reduced.

I spent a large amount of time replaying and replaying levels due to my constant deaths. The game is difficult, really, but it’s an amazing experience. The game started with a very simple story. Badguy shows up, badguy steals goods, goodguy must return the goods. It’s primitive, yes, and not really unnecessary, but it lays the foundation","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":0,"headerRowIndex":0}

Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention. While the invention has been illustrated and embodied in a mouse with supplementary control means and associated method for concurrent scrolling and cursor control, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. The advantage of the pattern set used (i.e., a linear horizontal mouse motion, a linear vertical mouse motion and a circular mouse motion) and the pattern-to-command assignment disclosed herein, is that all patterns are easily associated to the effect they produce on the display. In other words, a linear pattern can be intuitively associated to a gesture or sign to tell the computer that a scrolling direction parallel to that of the linear pattern is desired, while a circular pattern can be intuitively associated to a gesture to tell the computer that a scrolling scale altering the whole screen or window contents is desired.

Pat. No. 5,766,040 (Jun. 16, 1998) discloses a plug and jack contact set for twisted pair cable, wherein contact pins for each wire pair are individually shielded by the plug and the jack connectors of the set. Each pair of contact pins is located adjacent an outer shield cover of the associated connector, to maximize the spacing between pairs of contact pins on the connector. A so-called \"Category 7\" connector set with shielding about individual pairs of contact pins, is also offered by The Siemon Company. It would of course be desirable to provide a low crosstalk connector configuration that can be applied to existing wire networks without shielding, and nonetheless obtain a high level of crosstalk performance., 34637\u003dThis application is a continuation-in-part of our co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/031,807 filed Feb. 27, 1998., 35885\u003dCurrently, there is a concern in the connector industry over improving crosstalk performance of the modular type telephone plugs and jacks, especially to allow existing copper cable systems to compete with optical fiber networks. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,107 (Mar. 21, 1995); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,647 (Feb. 16, 1993). But characteristics inherent to the existing modular connector interface, tend to limit the amount of crosstalk reduction that can be achieved when using the connectors with copper cable systems. It would therefore be desirable to provide a plug and jack connector interface that excels in crosstalk performance relative to current modular connector designs. Preferably, such an interface should occupy a cross-section no greater than that of current modular connectors so that large scale field replacements can be easily carried out.}","textBeforeTable":"Citas de patentes While the foregoing description represents preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention pointed out by the following claims. For example, for applications requiring only three terminal pairs, the terminal pair configuration of FIG. 3 may be modified by eliminating one of the terminal pairs and leaving the other three in place on the terminal face. Further, the terminal configurations of FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 may be combined and repeated across a terminal face of most any dimensions, in order to accommodate more than four pairs of terminals all with extremely low crosstalk. The graph of FIG. 7 shows that when the terminal pairs are aligned in parallel planes, and the distance (D) between midpoints of the terminal pairs in a direction parallel to the planes is equal to the distance between the midpoints in a direction perpendicular to the planes as in FIG. 2, measured NEXT was at a minimum value of less than -100 dB at each of the three frequencies tested. Significantly, as the second terminal pair was displaced farther from the optimum (0.400 inch) position relative to the first terminal pair, measured NEXT initially increased by about 20 dB.

Naruto 5: Blood Prison A young Guy, along with Shizune, Asuma Sarutobi, and Kakashi Hatake, is seen waiting in a long line at the grand opening of the Ramen Ichiraku. Naruto Shippūden 4: The Lost Tower He made a cameo with Kakashi when Konoha received an urgent message from the Land of Demons. Guy later joins Kakashi, Tenten, Iruka Umino, and Anko Mitarashi in launching a counterattack against M??ry?? and his stone soldiers to buy time for Naruto, Neji, Sakura, and Lee, who were protecting Shion, to defeat M??ry??.

The name \"Might Guy\" is a joke aimed at the \"hot-headed hero\" archetype that appears in many movies and anime. Guy\u0027s appearance and mannerisms seem to be based off those of Bruce Lee. He even wields nunchaku and wears a jumpsuit. As of chapter 595, Guy has had all four of the compass point animals in Feng Shui associated with him: Morning Peacock being the Vermillion Bird, the Afternoon Tiger being the White Tiger, The Turtle as his summon and the Dragon being the basis of the design of his Nunchaku. According to the databook(s): Guy\u0027s hobbies are repeated side-steps, and hitting focus mitts. Guy wishes for a rematch with Kakashi. Guy\u0027s favourite foods are super-spicy curry rice and curry udon, though he finds it impossible to dislike food. Guy\u0027s favourite phrase is \"Overflowing youth!!\" (??????出??????春!!, Tobidase seishun!!).

3 b illustrates the steps performed for integrating the registration process of phone numbers and other identifiers such as domain names. A phone number may be selected in step 313 and determined available in step 315. When there is no interest in reserving in step 320 the selected phone number, or when it is determined in step 315 that a phone number is not available, then it may be determined in step 325 whether another available phone number is to be found. Steps (313, 315, 320) may be repeated until it is determined in step 320 that a new or existing subscriber would like to temporarily reserve the phone number while determining whether identifiers similar to the phone number may be available across other naming systems. Other naming systems may include keywords, domain names, trademarks, etc. For instance, the selected phone number, “555-1234?? is determined available and temporarily reserved, while it is determined in step 330 whether the domain name of the form, Phone.TLD (e.g., “555-1234.com??, “555-1234.net??, etc.) is checked for availability. If so, and the domain name is determined in step 335 to be available, and it is further determined in step 340 that the domain name is to be registered at this time, then the domain name may be registered in step 345. After the domain name is registered (step 345) or when the availability of the domain name is not to be determined (step 330) or the domain name is determined to be not available (step 335) or an available domain name is not to be registered at this time (step 340), then it may be determined in step 350 whether the reserved phone number is to be registered at this time. If this is the case, then the phone number may be registered in step 355. After phone number registration (step 355) or when it is determined that any reserved phone numbers are not to be registered (step 350), then all reserved phone numbers may be released in step 360 at this time. It then may be determined in step 325 whether another available phone number is to be found. Steps (313, 315, 320) may be repeated until it is determined in step 320 that a new or existing subscriber would like to temporarily reserve the available phone number and any of the above steps of FIG. 3 b may be repeated as needed. The above steps illustrate an overall system for integrating the allocation of phone numbers concurrently with other identifiers.}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{36493\u003dThe Internet is a vast computer network consisting of many smaller networks that span the world. A network provides a distributed communicating system of computers that are interconnected by various electronic communication links and computer software protocols. Because of the Internet\u0027s distributed and open network architecture, it is possible to transfer data from one computer to any other computer worldwide. In 1991, the World-Wide-Web (WWW or Web) revolutionized the way information is managed and distributed., 44222\u003dThe DNS is operated by a Network Information Center (NIC) in each country to act as authority for administering the respective ccTLD zone file portion of the DNS database. The Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) previously administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was formed to preside as authority over the gTLD zone files. In 1993, InterNIC was privatized and Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) was chosen to perform the registration and propagation of these key gTLDs, under a five-year cooperative agreement with the NSF., 51331\u003dU.S. Pat. No. 5,881,131 issued on Mar. 9, 1999 by Farris, et al., entitled, “Analysis and validation system for provisioning network related facilities?? discloses a service order processing system which determines a service request is provisionable and automatically provisions customer facilities including at least one of a domain name, a user name, a customer network address, and an electronic mail address, to execute the service request based upon information stored by the service order processing system. In addition, the \u0027131 patent discloses a system to access various trademark/tradename databases for determining any trademark conflicts with respect domain name availability. Such a system is used to provision physical network facilities as well as logical network facilities, such as identification related data, electronic mail, user name, domain name, and the like. Though the system contemplates the provisioning of identifiers for different naming systems, there is no mention or teaching of provisioning identifiers that intentionally have a specific correlation or connection to each other in order to help create a more unified identity across multiple naming systems., 103265\u003dSimilar to how domain names are generated in response to receiving keywords from a search request as explained in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/160,125 filed Oct. 18, 1999, by Schneider, entitled “Method and system for integrating resource location, search services, and registration services??, personalized identifiers may be generated in response to caller ID, user logins, automated dialing programs, bulk message programs, and the like., 53315\u003dCo-pending provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/157,075 filed Oct. 1, 1999, by Schneider, entitled “Method and apparatus for integrating resource location and registration services of valid and fictitious domain names?? discloses a robust system for managing both the resolution and registration of domain names having either a TLD or a TLDA (top level domain alias). However, there is no mention in the specification of the simultaneous registration of an identifier that can have both a TLD and TLDA., 100108\u003dIn addition, the suggestion or the temporary reservation of similar or matching telephone identifiers 630 either available or newly available across other area codes is another variation for the suggestive selling of identifiers (e.g., customer has the number 1-216-555-1234 and it is determined that a neighboring area code or another area code such as a toll-free area code has the number 1-330-555-1234, 1-800-555-1234, or mnemonic equivalent is available for subscription). A distributed database of telephone numbers may be maintained in a reverse hierarchy as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/440,606 filed Nov. 15, 1999, by Schneider, entitled “Method and apparatus for information delivery??. For instance, a “1234?? database may be maintained having data records representing telephone numbers across scattered geographies in the form of NPA-NXX-1234. A “1234?? control/reference file is sent, so that at any given point in time, the availability of telephone numbers ending with the number “1234?? may be more readily determined due to the minimized transmission of reference data., 52553\u003dWIPO Patent Application WO9909726A1 published on Feb. 25, 1999 by Broadhurst, entitled, “Method of determining unavailability of internet domain names?? discloses an improved query server that overcomes the shortcomings of existing domain name searching techniques by performing a multitude of searches simultaneously, transparent to the user. Specifically, the improved query server searches for existing domain name records in various domains and then displays the results in a formatted manner, thus eliminating the need for a user to perform individual searches. However, such techniques of finding similar identifiers are applied to the DNS only, which is a single naming system and does not consider multiple naming systems., 43151\u003dThere are two types of top-level domains, generic and country code. Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were created to allocate resources to the growing community of institutional networks, while country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) were created for use by each individual country, as deemed necessary. More than 240 national, or country-code TLDs (e.g., United States (.us), Japan (.jp), Germany (.de), etc.) are administered by their corresponding governments, or by private entities with the appropriate national government\u0027s acquiescence. A small set of gTLDs does not carry any national identifier, but denote the intended function of that portion of the domain space. For example, “.com?? was established for commercial networks, “.org?? for not-for-profit organizations, and “.net?? for network gateways. The set of gTLDs was established early in the history of the DNS and has not been changed or augmented in recent years (COM, ORG, GOV, and MIL were created by January 1985, NET in July 1985, and INT was added in November 1988)., 109449\u003dOther examples may include, third party vendors generating available identifiers in a domain name space from registered/unavailable identifiers extracted the from databases of other naming systems (e.g., Copyright, ISBN, UPC, or state and federal tradename and trademark data). Although the generation of available domain names are suggested or pushed via printed matter, e-mail, fax, etc. to a recipient such as a potential or existing registrant, customer, or subscriber as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/532,500 filed Mar. 21, 2000, by Schneider, entitled “Fictitious domain name method, product, and apparatus??, it is clear from the above illustration that there are additional steps that further support novelty of pushing, upselling, or the suggestive selling of available identifiers that may be suitable for registration of any given entity, registrant, or subscriber., 85587\u003dAs discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/440,606 filed Nov. 15, 1999, by Schneider, entitled “Method and apparatus for information delivery??, a subscriber/client may execute a program to generate mnemonic conversions of telephone numbers into letters or combination of letters/numbers for selecting what phone numbers might have a personal significance, or commercial purpose, etc. helping the public to identify potentially newly available desirable telephone numbers in advance. Though implied, the use of such naming tool programs on the provider side adds value by being able to generate available desirable names that are suggested to the customer, subscriber, or registrant. Suggestive selling of available identifiers creates a “push?? business model and generates more revenue by targeting desirable identifiers to recipients.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations The description herein with reference to the figures will be understood to describe the present invention in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the present invention in a variety of applications and devices.

application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/330,963, filed Nov. 5, 2001, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 41518\u003dSimilar concerns arise when it is necessary to drill precisely to a predetermined, distant point. Present practice is based upon determining the coordinates of the present drill bit location and those of the target and adjusting the drilling as it proceeds. Until recently these coordinates were determined by integrating a large ensemble of survey measurements from a surface location to the drill bit in conjunction with land surveys, with an ensemble of survey measurements to the target location. Recent developments have focused on making in situ determination of the apparent target location relative to the current drill bit location (A. G. Nekut, A. F. Kuckes and R. P. Pitzer, Rotating Magnet Ranging―a new drilling guidance technology, 8th One Day Conference on Horizontal Well Technology, Canadian Sections SPE/Petroleum Society, Nov. 7, 2001)., 61551\u003dTurning now to FIG. 4, a second embodiment of the invention is illustrated wherein a borehole 70 is to be drilled in a specified direction with respect to a cased reference well 72. Although other applications will be apparent, this embodiment will be described with respect to the drilling of a pair of parallel wells such as might be used in steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) systems. In such systems, the second borehole 70 is to be drilled so as to remain parallel to an existing, or reference well 72. This parallelism typically must be maintained for a borehole distance of 1000 meters with a spacing of 5 meters, +/?1 meter. As described above, in this environment it is extremely important that the driller know whether the direction of drilling is correct with respect to the existing well so that the required separation can be maintained. In this embodiment the sensor package 46 incorporating a 3-axis alternating field magnetometer and a 3-axis inclinometer is located in the reference well 72, with the z-axis of each of the sensors lying along the axis 76 of the well 72 and with the orientation of the x-y plane of the sensors in package 46 being perpendicular to that axis and being determined by the measurement of the gravity direction by the inclinometers. In this application Earth magnetic field sensors are usually of little use since the sensor package is deployed inside steel casing., 87584\u003dA test of the this method of determining the convergence/divergence of two approximately parallel wells was carried out in the course of evaluating the overall efficacy of using a rotating magnet source for drilling a SAGD well pair such as that discussed above with respect to FIG. 3 (A. G. Nekut, A. F. Kuckes and R. P. Pitzer, Rotating Magnet Ranging―a new drilling guidance technology, 8th One Day Conference on Horizontal Well Technology, Canadian Sections SPE/Petroleum Society, Nov. 7, 2001). FIG. 9 shows at 150 the overall well geometry and configuration employed. In the drilling well 152, permanent magnets were housed in a short sub 154 inserted immediately behind the bit 156 with a total dipole moment of several hundred amp m{circumflex over ( )}2. The sensor package 158 in the reference well 160, in this case in a lower producer well, included a three-component AC magnetometer to measure the three components of the time varying magnetic field (Hx, Hy, and Hz) generated by the rotating magnets. The analysis also used a 3-component accelerometer to measure gravity to determine the orientation of the sensor package.}","textBeforeTable":"Citas de patentes Although the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be understood that variations and modifications will become apparent to those of skill in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof, as set out in the accompanying claims. The x, y and z vectors of field 192 produced by the permanent magnet are measured at sensor package 46, as described above, along with the orientation of the sensor package, to determine the relative distance and direction from the package 46 to the magnetic field source. This information is obtained in the manner illustrated in FIG. 3 and described above. It will also be understood that the target location for a borehole being drilled need not be located underground. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 17, a drill assembly 180, which may be similar to those previously illustrated, may be used to drill a borehole 182 under the guidance of the field produced by a rotating permanent magnet 184 located at any arbitrary location; in this case, on the Earth\u0027s surface 186. The drill assembly includes a drill stem 18, nonmagnetic housing 20 for sensor package 46, and drill bit 12, as described above. The rotating magnet is driven by a motor, and the orientation of its axis of rotation is measured by sensors 190, which may be a level and compass, for example, or may be determined by","textAfterTable":"US9010461 1 Jun 2009 21 Abr 2015 Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.

Furthermore, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and process shown and described above. Accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims which follow. After the semiconductor manufacturing process using the apparatus of this invention is completed, the annular nozzle assembly 20 can be removed from the pipe segments 52, 58 and replaced or cleaned if necessary. A significantly less of amount of solid chains of polymerized TEOS molecules will be deposited on the inner surfaces 72, 85, 94, 96, 108 than would be deposited on the inner surfaces 54, 56 of the pipe segments 52, 58, respectively, using conventional techniques. In addition, the location of the vast majority, if not all, of the deposition of the solid chains of polymerized TEOS molecules will be located further downstream from the reaction furnace 21 than is currently possible using conventional techniques, thereby preventing particulate material comprising solid chains of polymerized TEOS molecules from flowing back through the furnace outlet 50 into the reaction furnace 21 and contaminating the wafers being processed in the reaction furnace 21.

No. 07/582,726, filed Sep. 14, 1990, now abandoned., 69629\u003dPublished PCT Patent Application WO 91/11975 of Technomed discloses an apparatus for the treatment of tissue, such as of the prostate, by hyperthermia and includes means for dilation. This apparatus includes means for providing microwave energy for hyperthermia, a dilation balloon toward the distal end of the apparatus, and fixation balloons both distal and proximal to the dilation balloon. The forward fixation balloon, distal to the dilation balloon, is positioned in the bladder. The dilation balloon is used to dilate the prostatic urethra, however, the disclosure suggests that dilation is used principally to dilate the lumen to compress tissue between the lumen wall and more remote tissue to be treated by hyperthermia. Nothing is disclosed about the ability of the dilation balloon to also dilate the bladder neck in the treatment of prostate disease., 94285\u003dBalloons fabricated from polyethylene and having preform diameter and length ratios in the above ranges have been found to have maximal burst pressures in the range of from about 53-68 psi, with an average of about 63 psi; and a hoop strength in the range of from about 9,500-13,300 lbs, with an average of about 11,200 lbs. Balloons fabricated for use as dilation and/or fixation balloons for catheters according to the present invention have a wall thickness in the range of from about 0.0016-0.0024 in., with an average of about 0.002 in.}","textBeforeTable":"Citas de patentes Such other conditions may include, but are not limited to, tumors of the esophagus and gastro-intestinal tract. It will be evident that appropriate adjustment in the dimensions of the apparatus may be required for use in treatment of other conditions to adapt it to the prevailing anatomical dimensions. Although the apparatus and method of its use principally discussed hereinabove relates to the treatment of prostate disease, it is not intended that the scope of the invention be limited to treatment of prostate disease, and it will be evident to one of skill in the art that the device and method disclosed herein are also applicable to the treatment of other conditions in which it is desired to simultaneously hyperthermally treat diseased target tissue in a patient while simultaneously effecting dilation of a lumen of a patient which has been compressed and obstructed by the diseased target tissue and/or surrounding tissue. Microwave antenna 22 is de-energized to terminate radiation of energy to the surrounding prostatic tissue. Dilation balloon 18 and fixation balloon 20 are then deflated by draining the inflation fluid therefrom and out through the drainage lumens. The apparatus is then in condition for withdrawal. The combined treatment procedure is completed, when the dilation balloon 18 has been allowed to remain expanded for an effective period of time to cause a widening of the prostatic urethra, and when an effective amount of microwave energy has","textAfterTable":"WO2004017876A2 * 8 Jul 2003 4 Mar 2004 Xanodyne Pharmacal Inc System and method using the rectal mucosal membrane for inducing hypotermia and warming WO2004026098A2 * 16 Sep 2003 1 Abr 2004 Celsion Corp Method for administering thermotherapy to prevent the growth of tumors WO2005104989A2 * 26 Abr 2005 10 Nov 2005 Martin T Gerber Esophageal delivery system and method with position indexing WO2005110265A2 * 27 Abr 2005 24 Nov 2005 Arrow Int Inc Cell necrosis apparatus with cooled microwave antenna WO2007019876A1 * 19 Ago 2005 22 Feb 2007 Neve Werner Francois De Device and method for assisting heat ablation treatment of the heart WO2007139555A1 * 31 May 2006 6 Dic 2007 Douglas O Chinn Tissue protective system and method for thermoablative therapies WO2008124938A1 * 16 Abr 2008 23 Oct 2008 Luya Li","hasKeyColumn":false,"keyColumnIndex":-1,"headerRowIndex":0}

He also qualified as a doctor of Chinese medicine. In 1956, after working for some years in Shanghai, Lin accepted a position at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Liu Dehai (born 1937) also born in Shanghai, was a student of Lin Shicheng and in 1961 graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Liu also studied with other musicians and has developed a style that combines elements from several different schools., 25105\u003dEarly literary tradition in China, for example in a 3rd-century description by Fu Xuan, Ode to Pipa,[2][21] associates the Han pipa with the northern frontier, Princess Liu Xijun, and Wang Zhaojun, who were married to nomad rulers of the Wusun and Xiongnu peoples in what is now Mongolia and northern Xinjiang respectively. Wang Zhaojun in particular was frequently referenced in later literary works, as well as in music pieces such as Zhaojun\u0027s Lament (昭???怨), and in paintings where she was often depicted holding a pipa., 11680\u003dThere are considerable confusion and disagreements about the origin of pipa. This may be due to the fact that the word pipa was used in ancient texts to describe a variety of plucked chordophones from the Qin to the Tang Dynasty, as well as the differing accounts given in these ancient texts. One traditional Chinese narrative recounts the story of the Han Chinese princess, Wang Zhaojun, who was sent to marry a Hun king as part of a peace accord during the Han Dynasty between the Hans and Huns, and the pipa was created so she can play music on horseback to soothe her longings.[1][2][3][4][5] Some researchers such as Laurence Picken and John Myers suggest a \"non-Chinese origin\".[6][7], 60654\u003dIn the 20th century, two of the most prominent pipa players were Sun Yude (孙裕德; 1904C1981) and Li Tingsong (???庭???; 1906C1976). Both were pupils of Wang Yuting (1872C1951), and both were active in establishing and promoting Guoyue (\"national music\"), which is a combination of traditional regional music and Western musical practices. Sun performed in the United States, Asia, and Europe, and in 1956 became deputy director of the Shanghai minzu yuetuan (Shanghai Folk Orchestra). As well as being one of the leading pipa players of his generation, Li held many academic positions and also carried out research on pipa scales and temperament. Wei Zhongle (???仲??; 1908 or 1909C1998) played many instruments, including the guqin. In the early 1950s, he founded the traditional instruments department at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Players from the Wang and Pudong schools were the most active in performance and recording during the 20th century, less active was the Pinghu school whose players include Fan Boyan (樊伯炎). Other noted players of the early 20th century include Liu Tianhua, a student of Shen Zhaozhou of the Chongming school and who increased the number of frets on the pipa and changed to an equal-tempered tuning, and the blind player Abing from Wuxi., 66900\u003dThe pipa has also been used in rock music; the California-based band Incubus featured one, borrowed from legendary guitarist Steve Vai, in their 2001 song \"Aqueous Transmission,\" as played by the group\u0027s guitarist, Mike Einziger.[51] The Shanghai progressive/folk-rock band Cold Fairyland, which was formed in 2001, also use pipa (played by Lin Di), sometimes multi-tracking it in their recordings. Australian dark rock band The Eternal use the pipa in their song \"Blood\" as played by singer/guitarist Mark Kelson on their album Kartika. The instrument is also played by musician Min Xiaofen in I See Who You Are, a song from Bj?rk\u0027s album Volta., 38982\u003dPipa has been played solo, or as part of a large ensemble or small group since the early times. Few pieces for pipa survived from the early periods, some however are preserved in Japan as part of togaku (Tang music) tradition. In the early 20th century, twenty-five pieces were found amongst 10th-century manuscripts in the Mogao caves near Dunhuang, most of these pieces however may have originated from the Tang Dynasty.[31] Three Ming Dynasty pieces were discovered in the Gaohe Jiangdong (高河江???) collection dating from 1528 which are very similar to those performed today, such as \"The Moon on High\" (月焊). During the Qing Dynasty, scores for pipa were collected in Thirteen Pieces for Strings.[32] During the Qing Dynasty there originally two major schools of pipa ― the Northern and Southern schools, and music scores for these two traditions were collected and published in the first mass-produced edition of solo pieces for pipa, now commonly known as the Hua Collection (?????V).[33] The collection was edited by Hua Qiuping (???秋???, 1784-1859) and published in 1818 in three volumes.[7] The first volume contains 13 pieces from the Northern school, the second and third volumes contain 54 pieces from the Southern school. Famous pieces such as \"Ambushed from Ten Sides\", \"The Warlord Takes Off His Armour\", and \"Flute and Drum at Sunset\" were first described in this collection. The earliest-known piece in the collection may be \"Eagle Seizing Swan\" (海?????天??) which was mentioned in a Yuan Dynasty text.[34] Other collections from the Qing Dynasty were compiled by Li Fangyuan (???芳@) and Ju Shilin (鞠士林), each representing different schools, and many of the pieces currently popular were described in these Qing collections. Further important collections were published in the 20th century., 69409\u003dThe electric pipa was developed in the late 20th century by adding electric guitarCstyle magnetic pickups to a regular acoustic pipa, allowing the instrument to be amplified through an instrument amplifier or PA system. In 2015, zhongruan player and composer Zhang Si\u0027an (张??安) - Djang San (Jean-Sébastien Héry). created his own electric pipa and recorded an experimental album around that instrument, \"Experimental Electric Pipa\". One year before that he had created his own electric zhongruan.}","lastModified":"Mon, 03 Aug 2015 03:14:06 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Famous solo pieces now performed include: The pipa pieces in the common repertoire can be categorized as wen (文, civil) or wu (武, martial), and da (大, large or suite) or xiao (??, small). The wen style is more lyrical and slower in tempo, with softer dynamic and subtler colour, and such pieces typically describe love, sorrow, and scenes of nature. Pieces in the Wu style are generally more rhythmic and faster, and often depict scenes of battles and are played in a vigorous fashion employing a variety of techniques and sound effects. The wu style was associated more with the Northern school while the wen style was more the Southern school. The da and xiao categories refer to the size of the piece - xiao pieces are small pieces normally containing only one section, while da pieces are large and usually contain multiple sections. The traditional pieces however often have a standard metrical length of 68 measures or beat.[35] Pipa has been played solo, or as part of a large ensemble or small group since the early times.

Examples of popular modern works composed after the 1950s are \"Dance of the Yi People\" and \"Heroic Little Sisters of the Grassland\" (???原英雄????妹). Non-traditional themes may be used in these new compositions and some may reflect the political landscape and demands at the time of composition, for example \"Dance of the Yi People\" which is based on traditional melodies of the Yi people, may be seen as part of the drive for national unity, while \"Heroic Little Sisters of the Grassland\" extols the virtue of those who served as model of exemplary behaviour in the People\u0027s commune.[36] Schools[edit] Scene from a Ming Dynasty painting, Tao Gu Presents a Poem, c. 1515, by Tang Yin.

In a tremendous demonstration of will, Hanz?? places his faith in Mifune and ― overcoming the talisman that governed his actions ― he committed \"seppuku\" (切腹, stomach-cutting) with his broken kusarigama. Piercing the internal venom gland located within his body in the process, an enormous poisonous cloud was released that paralysed the entirety of Hanz??\u0027s movements, creating an opening for the Fifth Division to exploit in order to bind, and seal him away for the remainder of the war. With the later release of the Impure World Reincarnation, Hanz??\u0027s soul was returned to the afterlife. Hanz??, in his final act, commits seppuku.

Hanz?? may have been named after a famous real-life samurai and widely believed ninja Hattori Hanz?? (??部???i). This is further accentuated by his connections with samurai of the Naruto universe and his final act of suicide, typical of real-life samurai. It is popular Japanese legend that Hattori Hanz?? was killed by Fūma Kotar??. Pain\u0027s first Animal Path was said to be from the Fūma clan. He may also be named after the Japanese giant salamander. This species is also called the hanzaki (???割), which shares the first kanji with Hanz??\u0027s name. Hanz??\u0027s nickname and his element affinity have significant meaning because in ancient mythology, although being amphibious, the salamander was considered the living symbol of fire and as such was completely fireproof and able to live in fire itself. In the anime Mifune reveals that Hanz?? was rumoured to never have had a proper burial, but picks up a piece of his broken respirator and opts to give him one himself, wondering where would be most suitable.[15]","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":0,"headerRowIndex":0}
