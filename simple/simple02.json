In operation, the elastomeric isolator 18 functions to isolate the vibrations of the compressor foot 13 from the base pan 12. Vertical vibrations of the foot 13 are absorbed by the elastomeric isolator being placed in varying degrees of compression. The transverse vibrations are absorbed by the elastomeric isolator 18 being placed in varying degrees of sheer stress. The application of a solid elastomeric element rather than one having a stud passing therethrough, allows for substantially greater flexibility and improved vibration damping performance. Having described the structure, the method of manufacture will now be described. First, an adhesive is applied to the top surface of the hex head 21 of the lower stud 16 and to the bottom surface of the imbedded portion 23 of the upper stud 17. The adhesive is also allowed to run over the edges to the side surfaces of those elements. The hex head 21 and the embedded portion 23 are then placed into mold cavities and the mold is closed. Hot fluid neoprene is then injected into the cavities.

It is recognized that the Venturi meter principle is based on the reduction of pressure accompanied by a related increase in velocity, and that other means, other than a Venturi meter, using the above principle may be used to develope the differential pressure Δp. It will be appreciated that the two measurements made above may, if desired, be made in reverse order in which case the mixture flows first through the thermal flowmeter where the quantity Δt is evaluated and then through the other flowmeter wherein a change in mixture velocity is produced to produce a differential pressure Δp. In such case the equations set forth above are again combined and the x term in the resulting third order polynominal equation is evaluated in the computer means 9.

Indeed, it is envisioned that the camera system of FIGS. 6-7 could be readily employed to inspect other container sections, such as container sidewalls and bases, to inspection of container caps, and to inspection of other diverse items such as nuts and bolts, etc. When tracking threads, one line or a few lines near the threads could remain unintegrated (high resolution), and one or more lines on each side could be integrated several times. This technique would yield information over a wider range, but with reduced data amount, if the threads move out of the high resolution area. Data lines of interest could be incremented in each frame to produce a two-dimensional image of thread contour. The camera arrangement of FIGS. 6 and 7 thus comprises a high speed computer-controlled camera in which all of the following may be readily controlled in real time: horizontal resolution, vertical resolution, pixel sensitivity, pixel size, pixel data to be read from the array, pixel data to be loaded into the computer for further processing and analysis, and frame time. The first six of these parameters may be controlled on a pixel-by-pixel basis. It will also be appreciated that computer-controlled camera arrangement of FIGS. 6 and 7 is not limited to five scan lines 80a-88a, or to reading of a full data","textAfterTable":"DE102012022474A1 * Nov 19, 2012 May 22, 2014 Khs Corpoplast Gmbh Inspektionsanordnung f?r Beh?lterm?ndungen DE102012022474B4 * Nov 19, 2012 Jun 26, 2014 Khs Corpoplast Gmbh Inspektionsanordnung f?r Beh?lterm?ndungen EP0697592A1 Aug 12, 1995 Feb 21, 1996 Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc.

Citations The container of the present invention is intended to be located beneath the table 324 of automatic apparatus for testing samples or other similar apparatus, being supported on a lower partition wall 325 and extending practically for the entire width of the table which in practice determines the length of the container 301. For improved positioning of the container, the cell in which it is disposed has a rear abutment 326 which establishes the axial position of the container which is easily introduced from the front portion of the cell. On the front portion or head 302 of the container, there are lower projections 320 and 321 preferably forming a single body but defining two separate bearing points such as 322 and 323 for the container. The moulded structure of the container provides for the container to have, in its working position, its upper surface 318 substantially horizontal and its lower surface 319 inclined forwardly from the rear to permit more complete emptying of the container through the front connector 311. The rear step 327 fits in a support or mounting 317 of a loading cell, enabling the degree of filling of the container to be monitored. The rear end 303 also has a fixed outlet 314 for a connector of a similar nature to those mentioned above, possibly connectible by means of a pipe 315 to one of the front connectors 306 to facilitate the","textAfterTable":"Referenced by Citing Patent Filing date Publication date Applicant Title US6403035 * Sep 14, 1999 Jun 11, 2002 Roche Diagnostics Corporation Apparatus for transporting components within an automatic analyzer system US6485918 Jul 2, 2001 Nov 26, 2002 Packard Bioscience Corporation Method and apparatus for incubation of a liquid reagent and target spots on a microarray substrate US6495369 * Apr 7, 2000 Dec 17, 2002 Caliper Technologies Corp.

However, the diameter r3 is larger than the diameter r4 of the corrected transmitted light of the reading light without the auxiliary light shown in FIG. 15.

In accordance with the present invention, the photochromic film is provided on the optical disc for changing the transmittance or the reflectance thereof by the light having a different wavelength. The information pits are read out by one of the lights and masked by the other light. Thus, it is possible to control the information reading zone. Furthermore, the information is reproduced by the light corresponding to the distribution of intensities of the lights. Thus, the recorded information only in a reading area can be reproduced without crosstalking. As shown in FIG. 16, if the auxiliary light is emitted in the form of ring in sectional shape, the diameter is smaller than the diameter of the light of the circle as shown in FIG. 17 and approximately the same as the diameter r4 in FIG. 15. It is possible to reproduce information of high recording density. Since the area before and after the reading light is masked by the auxiliary light, the recording density in the recording track direction is increased without increasing crosstalk.

Klassifizierung der Twinjets mit prim?r zivilem Einsatz nach Abmessung und Produktion[Bearbeiten] Der Einsatz zweistrahliger Modelle wird durch die ETOPS-Regelungen aus Sicherheitsgründen beschr?nkt, insbesondere auf Pol-Strecken (z.?B. Singapur-New York). Die Triebwerke sind generell gr??er als bei drei- oder mehrstrahligen Flugzeugen, dadurch effizienter im Einsatz. Die Triebwerke sind relativ leistungsst?rker, da im Notfall ein einziges Triebwerk das Flugzeug antreiben k?nnen muss (1/2 Maximalleistung). Damit verbunden ist auch eine h?here Steigleistung (da das Flugzeug relativ ?übermotorisiert“ ist). Die Betriebsleistung selbst ist niedriger als bei vierstrahligen Flugzeugen und damit weiter entfernt vom optimalen Betriebspunkt der Triebwerke. Flugzeuge mit zwei Triebwerken sind im Allgemeinen betriebsgünstiger als Flugzeuge mit mehr Triebwerken. Allerdings muss sichergestellt werden, dass bei Ausfall eines Triebwerks das Flugzeug noch ausreichend lange mit dem anderen Triebwerk geflogen werden kann, um eine sichere Landung zu erm?glichen. Die ETOPS-Regelungen der ICAO müssen sehr genau eingehalten werden, insbesondere bei transozeanischen Flügen. Vor- und Nachteile[Bearbeiten] Seltener ist eine direkte Integration der Triebwerke in die Tragfl?chen (z.?B. Lockheed SR-71), nicht zuletzt aufgrund von Sicherheitsaspekten.

Klassifizierung der Twinjets mit prim?r zivilem Einsatz nach Abmessung und Produktion[Bearbeiten] Der Einsatz zweistrahliger Modelle wird durch die ETOPS-Regelungen aus Sicherheitsgründen beschr?nkt, insbesondere auf Pol-Strecken (z.?B. Singapur-New York). Die Triebwerke sind generell gr??er als bei drei- oder mehrstrahligen Flugzeugen, dadurch effizienter im Einsatz. Die Triebwerke sind relativ leistungsst?rker, da im Notfall ein einziges Triebwerk das Flugzeug antreiben k?nnen muss (1/2 Maximalleistung). Damit verbunden ist auch eine h?here Steigleistung (da das Flugzeug relativ ?übermotorisiert“ ist). Die Betriebsleistung selbst ist niedriger als bei vierstrahligen Flugzeugen und damit weiter entfernt vom optimalen Betriebspunkt der Triebwerke. Flugzeuge mit zwei Triebwerken sind im Allgemeinen betriebsgünstiger als Flugzeuge mit mehr Triebwerken. Allerdings muss sichergestellt werden, dass bei Ausfall eines Triebwerks das Flugzeug noch ausreichend lange mit dem anderen Triebwerk geflogen werden kann, um eine sichere Landung zu erm?glichen. Die ETOPS-Regelungen der ICAO müssen sehr genau eingehalten werden, insbesondere bei transozeanischen Flügen. Vor- und Nachteile[Bearbeiten] Seltener ist eine direkte Integration der Triebwerke in die Tragfl?chen (z.?B. Lockheed SR-71), nicht zuletzt aufgrund von Sicherheitsaspekten.

He has yet to direct a feature based on a script other than his own (though Ashes of Time was rather loosely adapted from a Louis Cha novel), which would be highly unlikely considering his method of improvisation. Wong, through Jet Tone, is also the producer of all of his own films since 1993 with the exception of Ashes of Time, a project that began much earlier. Through Jet Tone or otherwise, Wong has also produced various films, some directed by his partner in the company, Jeffrey Lau. Here are lists of films other than his own that Wong wrote screenplays for or produced:, 28306\u003dWong established his independent production company, called Jet Tone Films Ltd, with director and producer Jeffrey Lau. His next film, 2046 (2004), about capturing lost memories, was the third chapter of a shared story that began with Days of Being Wild and continued with In the Mood for Love. Infamous for long, drawn-out shoots without any real regards to deadlines[citation needed], a running joke amongst the crew was that he would finish in the year 2046. In 2006, Wong became the first Chinese director to preside the jury at the Cannes Film Festival., 13690\u003dIn 2006, Wong accepted the National Order of the Legion of Honour: Knight (Lowest Degree) from the French Government. In 2013, Wong accepted Order of Arts and Letters: Commander (Highest Degree) by the French Minister of Culture.[4], 61450\u003dIn 1992, the Taiwanese singer, Tracy Huang ying ying\u0027s song \u0027To make you happy\u0027 music video was directed by Wong Kar-Wai, starring Hong Kong actor, Leung kar fai. In 2000 Wong directed a music video of Tony Leung\u0027s duet with Niki of a song from the In the Mood for Love soundtrack to be included in Tony Leung\u0027s CD by the same name and on the French DVD release of In the Mood for Love. In 2002 Wong helmed the music video Six Days for DJ Shadow featuring Chang Chen and Danielle Graham., 72155\u003dFlaming Brothers aka Dragon and Tiger Fight (1987), The Eagle Shooting Heroes (1993), First Love: the Litter on the Breeze (1997), Chinese Odyssey 2002 (2002), Sound of Colors (2003), The Ferryman (2015)., 24272\u003dWong\u0027s fourth movie, Ashes of Time (1994), released between Chungking Express and Fallen Angels, applied his approach to a star-studded wuxia (martial arts swordplay) story; the desert shoot in Mainland China dragged on for over a year and resulted in one of contemporary Hong Kong cinema\u0027s most notorious commercial disasters. His first major international recognition was at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival where he won the Best Director prize for Happy Together (1997).[8] It \"uses gorgeous, saturated images set to an eclectic soundtrack of tango by Argentinian maestro Astor Piazzolla, Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso and Frank Zappa instrumentals to chronicle the stormy affair of a gay couple living as expatriates in Buenos Aires.\"[9], 55517\u003dIn 1996 he shot wkw/tk/1996@7′55″hk.net for Japanese designer Takeo Kikuchi, starring Tadanobu Asano and Karen Mok; in 1997[13] he helmed a three-minute commercial for the Motorola StarTAC starring Tadanobu and Faye Wong;[14][15][16][17] in 2000 he produced a Yang Zi-directed commercial for Suntime Wine with Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Maggie Cheung[18] and directed a segment for JCDecaux\u0027s Un matin partout dans le monde, a commercial featuring different kinds of dawns in cities around the world shot by famous movie directors;[19] in 2001 he directed the TV spot Dans la ville for the French mobile network company Orange France [20] and the short film The Hire: The Follow as part of the BMW films initiative; in 2002 he helmed La Rencontre, a commercial for Lacoste starring Chang Chen and fr:Diane de Mac Mahon;[21] in 2005 he filmed an ad for Dior\u0027s Capture Totale perfume starring Sharon Stone. Around 21 September 2006, in Prague, he directed a commercial (released in early 2007) for Lanc?me Paris\u0027s Hypn?se Homme perfume starring Clive Owen and Daria Werbowy. Around 25 June 2007, again in Prague, he directed a set of commercials for SoftBank, starring Brad Pitt. Also in 2007 he directed an ad for Dior\u0027s Midnight Poison perfume starring Eva Green and featuring Muse\u0027s song \"Space Dementia\". On 30 August 2007, There\u0027s Only One Sun, a short film he scripted and directed for Philips\u0027 Aurea HD Flat TV, starring Amélie Daure, premiered at the IFA in Berlin. On 18 October 2011, Mask, his Charles Bukowski (\"Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame\")-inspired commercial for Japanese cosmetics line Shu Uemura starring Taiwanese actress Sandrine Pinna, was released on YouTube.[22][23] His short film for Chivas Regal 25, Déjà vu, starring Chang Chen and Du Juan premiered during the 2012 Cannes Film Festival at the Chivas House on the Chérie Chéri beach in Cannes.[24], 62399\u003dHis short film Hua yang de nian hua is a montage of scenes from vintage Chinese films, most of which were considered lost until some nitrate prints were discovered in a California warehouse during the 1990s, set to a song from the soundtrack of In the Mood for Love, it was shown at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival.[25] Wong also contributed two segments to two omnibus films: in 2004 \"The Hand\" to Eros and in 2007 \"I Travelled 9000 km to Give It to You\" to To Each His Own Cinema., 18335\u003dBorn in Shanghai, he moved to Hong Kong with his parents in 1963. Coming from Mainland China only speaking Mandarin and Shanghainese, he spent hours in cinemas with his mother. In 1980, after studying two years at Hong Kong Polytechnic College in graphic design, he enrolled in the Production Training Course organised by Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) and became a full-time television screenwriter. In the mid-1980s, he became a screenwriter/director at The Wing Scope Co. and In-gear Film Production Company, the production houses owned by renowned Hong Kong actor /movie producer Alan Tang., 19453\u003dWong\u0027s current style took shape during his apprenticeship with Alan Tang Kwong-Wing, who invested in the first movie he directed, As Tears Go By (1988). Wong\u0027s career took off when he directed the film Days of Being Wild (1990), despite losing Alan Tang millions of invested dollars. He is credited with about ten scripts between 1982 and 1987, covering an array of genres from romantic comedy to action drama, but claims to have worked to some extent or another on about fifty more without official credit.[5] He also wrote the script of Final Victory (最後??利, 1986) for his mentor Patrick Tam Kar Ming. [6], 12370\u003dWong was the first Chinese director to win the Best Director Award of Cannes Film Festival (for his work Happy Together in 1997). Wong was the President of the Jury at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which makes him the only Chinese person to preside over the jury at the Cannes Film Festival. He was also the President of the Jury at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2013.[2], 21208\u003dHe made his directing debut in 1988 with As Tears Go By, produced by Alan Tang. A crime melodrama of the kind then hugely popular, it heavily borrowed from Martin Scorsese\u0027s Mean Streets (1974), but already displayed one of Wong\u0027s principal trademarks in its atmospheric and sometimes expressionistic color palette. His next film, Days of Being Wild (1990), a drama about aimless youth set in the early 1960s, established his trademark form: elliptically plotted mood pieces, with lush visuals and music, about the burden of memory on melancholic, misfit characters. Days was a box office failure but now regularly tops Hong Kong critics\u0027 polls of the best local films ever made. It has been likened by numerous critical commentators to Rebel Without a Cause, with a central theme of loss.[7], 29340\u003dWong Kar-wai\u0027s first full English-language film, My Blueberry Nights (2007), opened the 2007 Cannes Film Festival as one of 22 films in competition. The lead, American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, made her acting debut in the film. His next film, The Grandmaster was released in 2013., 25897\u003dThe filming of In the Mood for Love (2000) had to be shifted from Beijing to Macau after the Chinese Film Bureau demanded to see the completed script. This was all in all a minor setback in the \"very complicated evolution\" of the project which goes as far back as 1997. It was Wong\u0027s intention to make two films, one of which would be titled Beijing Summer, the plot unclear at the time, but eventually taking form in Macau. Here Wong planned to call it Three Stories About Food but saw it better to settle for only one story, A Story About Food, that centres on a writer. Including scenes shot in Bangkok and Angkor Wat, the filming took 15 months. This was an especially arduous time for lead actress Maggie Cheung whose hair and makeup reportedly took five hours each day. She compared the lengthy shoot to a cold she couldn\u0027t get rid of[citation needed]. Working without deadlines, the film\u0027s upcoming première at Cannes nonetheless put some pressure on Wong to finish editing. Intending to name the film Secrets he was dissuaded by Cannes, as there were already many films with that title,[10] and finally named it In the Mood for Love after listening to Bryan Ferry\u0027s recording of the song I\u0027m in the Mood for Love.[11][12], 10641\u003dWong Kar-wai, BBS (born 17 July 1958) is a Hong Kong Second Wave filmmaker, internationally renowned as an auteur for his visually unique, highly stylised, emotionally resonant work, including Days of Being Wild (1990), Ashes of Time (1994), Chungking Express (1994), Fallen Angels (1995), Happy Together (1997), 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013). His film In the Mood for Love (2000), starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, garnered widespread critical acclaim. Wong\u0027s films frequently feature protagonists who yearn for romance in the midst of a knowingly brief life and scenes that can often be described as sketchy, digressive, exhilarating, and containing vivid imagery.[1]}","lastModified":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Awards and Nominations[edit] Flaming Brothers aka Dragon and Tiger Fight (1987), The Eagle Shooting Heroes (1993), First Love: the Litter on the Breeze (1997), Chinese Odyssey 2002 (2002), Sound of Colors (2003), The Ferryman (2015).

photographer 8 can request that a copy of a digital image be downloaded (or sent) to a local remote machine from the image server 16. (see e.g., 5g, FIG. 5B and 5q, FIG. 5F). Preferably, the photographer 8 obtains a high-resolution copy of the digital image (e.g., 1024?1536 pixels) in order to retain a high-quality digital image. The photographer a may generate a digital image of sufficient detail to order additional formats of the image based on the new digital image., 41657\u003dIn a preferred embodiment, scanning occurs from the negative before the negative strip is cut. The negative is preferably scanned after the photographic film is developed and before any photographic prints are created. In a most preferred embodiment, all photographic images in the negative strip are scanned in a single pass by the scanner 9d. In an alternate embodiment, the negative strips are spliced together on a film reel 9e in a manner well known in the photographic industry, and the rolls are scanned automatically by a high-volume commercially available scanner 9d. Developed photographic prints may be scanned on a flatbed scanner (a typical set of prints from a roll can be scanned in about 10-20 minutes). Regardless of the method used to acquire the digital image, the preferred minimum size for the resulting image is 1024?1536 pixels with 24-bit color. It will be appreciated that color and exposure correction of the digital image may be performed after scanning using techniques well known in the art.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations Having described presently preferred embodiments of the invention, it may be otherwise embodied within the scope of the following claims. The patent applications, patents and documents referred to herein are hereby incorporated by reference. The creation of the visual prints from the digital image is performed using standard equipment available in the industry. In a preferred embodiment, a film recorder 6a, see FIG. 6 such as an Opal recorder from Management Graphics, Inc. is used to generate a photographic negative from the digital image. The negative 6b is then used to generate a visual print 6c which is identical to the digital image on the appropriate merchandise. In an alternate embodiment, a cathode ray tube printer 6d such as those available from Konica USA or Bremson Inc. creates the visual prints on photographic paper directly from the digital image. It will be appreciated that this avoids the cost of creating a negative, while still preserving the quality of a photographic print. For non-paper items such as mugs 6f or T-shirts 6g, the visual print 6c can be printed directly from the digital image, and adhered to an item using a heat transfer system 6e of a type well known in the art. In yet another embodiment, an alternate photographic printing method can be used, such as the Pictography 3000 system available from FujiFilm.

Suitable enzymes are pepsin, trypsin, pronase, proctase, etc. Two fractions are obtained from this digestion, one an insoluble solid fraction which is discarded, and a solution or soluble fraction which is worked up as follows. The solution is brought to a pH of about 10.0 to denature the remaining active enzyme, and then neutralized to a pH of about 6.0-7.0. \"Atelocollagen\" precipitates at this pH leaving behind in solution (to be discarded) the digested telopeptides, and other contaminating proteins, and any saccharides, mucopolysaccharides, etc. The atelocollagen is usually further purified by repeating solubilization at pH 2-3 and reprecipitation at pH 6-7. The recovered collagen is then washed with ethanol to remove any lipid content and excess water in preparation for the solvent defatting process. The collagen is defatted by treatment with 1:1 ethanol-ethyl ether mixture and recovered as a viscous solid usually by cheesecloth filtering. It is then air-dried, and subsequently converted to a gel by solubilization in acidified water at a pH of about 3.0., 10902\u003dThis is a division of application Ser.

However, it is appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon consideration of the specification, may make modifications and improvements within the spirit and scope of the invention. Thin slices of the pellets formed in Examples 1 and 2 were examined by electron microscopy. The section of the pellet of Example 1 exhibited no apparent structure. The section of the pellet of Example 2 exhibited thin strand-like structures. EXAMPLE 3 An ultracentrifuged pellet of native soluble collagen was formed the same as in Example 1 except prior to the step of ultracentrifuging, the collagen solution was dialyzed against water, forming a clear gel. The gel was then transferred to a test tube for ultracentrifugation. A transparent pellet formed as in Example 1. When fixed, the pellet exhibited optical clarity and rigidity, and was leather-like in consistency. EXAMPLE 2 A pellet was fixed using a solution of 2% formaldehyde made from paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer (available commercially from Aldrich Corporation). About 5 ml of the fixing solution was placed in the centrifuge tube with the pellet for about 30 min. at 4? C.

example, if a significant increase in network utilization occurs every Monday at 9:00 a.m. (i.e., the upper threshold is crossed), an alarm may be generated every Monday even though this is a common event that does not necessarily indicate a network problem. Similarly, if a significant increase in network utilization occurs (without crossing the upper threshold) at a time when the network utilization is typically minimal, an alarm is not generated even though a network problem may exist. Thus, existing systems do not consider typical or historical network operation when determining whether a network problem exists., 56343\u003dIn a particular embodiment of the invention, a separate cognitive signature is provided for each day of the week. A cognitive signature for a particular day of the week may include data separated into multiple time periods (e.g., each hour of the day). For example, a cognitive signature for Tuesday may include a particular time period that represents the normal operating mode (based on collected historical data) for a particular network device from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday. A cognitive signature for Saturday may include a time period that represents the normal operating mode for a particular network interface from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. Additional details regarding cognitive signatures are discussed below., 68368\u003dFor example, if several network servers are down for maintenance from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on a particular Friday, the portion of the cognitive signature associated with that time period on Friday is not adjusted. When several network servers are down, data collected from the network is likely to be significantly different from the data that would be collected if the servers were operating. For example, response time may increase significantly when a network device is down or malfunctioning. Updating the cognitive signature in this situation would incorrectly skew the cognitive signatures. Thus, rather than incorporating this atypical information into the cognitive signatures, one or more network parameters are ignored during the time period during which the network servers are down. Therefore, the cognitive signatures associated with these network parameters is not changed., 71382\u003dIn another situation, a particular cognitive signature may not be highly correlated, indicating that the collected data varies significantly. For example, network utilization between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on Monday may vary between 20 percent and 80 percent. In this situation, the correlation factor may be 0.2., 42907\u003dThese existing systems that use thresholds to identify network problems determine the threshold values (e.g., upper limits) based on how the network administrator believes the network should operate. Since these thresholds are typically static, they do not change automatically with changes in the network operation or network configuration. Instead, the network administrator must recalculate (or re-estimate) threshold values manually when a network change occurs. Typically, a single set of threshold values are used for all time periods. Thus, the same thresholds may be used during periods of heavy network utilization (e.g., 2:00 p.m. on a business day) and during periods of minimal network utilization (e.g., 10:00 p.m. on a holiday). Thus, the same threshold values are applied at all times, regardless of the expected or historical network utilization., 74583\u003dReferring to FIG. 6A, the horizontal axis represents time-of-day and the vertical axis represents the utilization of the network (measured from zero percent to 100 percent). Cognitive signature 91 shows that network utilization is generally highest around 4:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. Thus, a high network utilization at 11:15 a.m. on a Tuesday might not represent a problem since the utilization parameter is within cognitive signature 91 (i.e., between the peak line 91 b and the minimum line 91 c). However, a high network utilization at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday represents a problem (or a potential problem) because cognitive signature 91 indicates that, historically, network utilization has not been high at that time. Similarly, a low network utilization at 4:00 a.m. on Tuesday may indicate a problem because cognitive signature 91 indicates that the network utilization has historically been high at that time. Therefore, cognitive signature 91 is used to identify problems when the associated parameter exceeds peak line 91 b or falls below minimum line 91 c., 69277\u003dException information 86 contains network operation and performance data regarding infrequent events and events that do not follow a regular pattern. For example, if an increase in network utilization occurs every Monday from 9:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m., the information is included in a cognitive signature because the event occurs on a regular basis. However, other events may occur on an irregular basis. For example, a significant increase in network utilization may occur on the last business day of each month. Similarly, a significant decrease in network utilization may occur on holidays. These irregular but schedulable events are not incorporated into the cognitive signatures 82 and, instead, are stored as separate exception information 86. Cognitive signature generator 80 creates and maintains separate cognitive signatures for each event that occurs on an irregular but schedulable basis. Thus, when selecting an appropriate cognitive signature for use in analyzing current network operation and performance, cognitive signature generator 80 considers both cognitive signatures 82 and exception information 86., 91010\u003dIn one embodiment of the invention, step 128 in FIG. 8 also determines whether the current data is within the cognitive signature for the previous time period or within the cognitive signature for the next time period. Thus, step 128 compares the current data to three different cognitive signatures (i.e., the cognitive signatures for the previous, current, and next time periods). By comparing the current data to the previous time period and the next time period, the procedure is able to identify a pattern or event that is shifted in time. For example, a high network utilization may typically occur between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. If a high network utilization occurs between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., the procedure may not consider it to be unusual because high network utilization typically occurs during the next time period. By analyzing adjacent cognitive signatures, the procedure is able to avoid generating false alarms when a typical pattern or event has been shifted in time to an adjacent time period., 70478\u003dCognitive signature generator 80 also produces signature correlation factors 88, which indicate the degree of correlation associated with each cognitive signature. The signature correlation factors indicate, based on historical data, the likelihood that a particular network parameter will fall within the range of values defined by the cognitive signature. Certain performance data may be relatively constant from one week to the next during a particular time period. For example, network utilization between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on Saturday may be between five percent and ten percent with very infrequent deviations. In this example, the signature correlation factor may be 0.9, indicating that there is a 90 percent likelihood that the collected data associated with the cognitive signature will be within the range of values specified by the cognitive signature.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations From the above description and drawings, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the particular embodiments shown and described are for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Januar 1912, dem Datum der Gründung der Republik China, durch den gregorianischen Kalender abgel?st.

Die Regierung der Kuomintang erneuerte daher die Einführung des gregorianischen Kalenders am 1. Januar 1929, und mit der Gründung der Volksrepublik China im Jahr 1949 galt der westliche Kalender in ganz China. In der Volksrepublik China wurde dabei auch die westliche Zeitrechnung mit der Z?hlung ab Christi Geburt übernommen, wohingegen in der Republik China auf Taiwan auf offiziellen Dokumenten ab Gründung der Republik im Jahr 1912 gez?hlt wird (siehe hierzu Minguo-Kalender)., 2870\u003dDer heutige Kalender gilt seit der Reform von 1645, die mit Hilfe der Jesuiten (Adam Schall von Bell) durchgeführt wurde.

Januar 1912, dem Datum der Gründung der Republik China, durch den gregorianischen Kalender abgel?st.

Die Regierung der Kuomintang erneuerte daher die Einführung des gregorianischen Kalenders am 1. Januar 1929, und mit der Gründung der Volksrepublik China im Jahr 1949 galt der westliche Kalender in ganz China. In der Volksrepublik China wurde dabei auch die westliche Zeitrechnung mit der Z?hlung ab Christi Geburt übernommen, wohingegen in der Republik China auf Taiwan auf offiziellen Dokumenten ab Gründung der Republik im Jahr 1912 gez?hlt wird (siehe hierzu Minguo-Kalender)., 2870\u003dDer heutige Kalender gilt seit der Reform von 1645, die mit Hilfe der Jesuiten (Adam Schall von Bell) durchgeführt wurde.

Schaltmonate[Bearbeiten] Die Berechnung des chinesischen Kalenders ist deswegen so kompliziert, weil sie nicht auf den Mittelwerten fu?t sondern auf den exakten astronomischen Stellungen von Mond und Sonne. Die Zeit zwischen zwei Zh??ngqì schwankt zwischen 29,44 und 31,44 Tagen, die eines synodischen Monats zwischen 29,27 und 29,84 Tagen. Daher kommt es in seltenen F?llen vor, dass auf einen Monat zwei Zh??ngqì fallen und es Monate gibt, auf die kein Zh??ngqì f?llt, die aber nicht Schaltmonate sind (scheinbare Schaltmonate). Wird ein Schaltmonat notwendig, so ist der erste Monat zwischen zwei Wintersonnenwenden, auf den kein Zh??ngqì f?llt, ein Schaltmonat. Der Schaltmonat erh?lt dieselbe Zahl wie der vorherige Monat. Wenn der Schaltmonat beispielsweise dem zweiten Monat (二月) folgt, dann hei?t er einfach ?Geschalteter Zweiter Monat“ (??二月?/?闰二月, rùn’èryuè). Die Wintersonnenwende der Nordhalbkugel f?llt immer auf den 11. Monat. Der Neumond f?llt immer auf den ersten Tag eines Monats. Der Tag beginnt um Mitternacht.

The ISO, which manages the power grid delivering electricity to the state, has estimated total power company overcharges at nearly $6 billion. Before the new complaint filed by the Attorney General, FERC proposed refunds for only $124 million in alleged overcharges for energy sales in January and February 2001 when power reserves in the state dropped below 1.5 percent., 5874\u003d\"California wants full refunds from power companies that charged unjust and unreasonable prices for short-term sales in California before October, 2001,\" Lockyer said. \"Under the Federal Power Act and FERC\u0027s own orders, California energy wholesalers should have filed every rate they charged in California with FERC so that the regulatory agency could do its job of determining whether the prices were just and reasonable. The power companies have not filed any of their market-based rates, making every sale illegal and subject to review and refund for excessive charges.\", 1406\u003dThe petition for refunds is the latest energy filing by the Attorney General, whose Energy Task Force has been investigating potential illegal conduct by power companies and others during California\u0027s energy crisis. Last week, the Attorney General filed complaints against four major power generators seeking refunds of more than $150 million for illegal, unfair and fraudulent business practices in the sale of electricity on the market that had been sold earlier for reserve capacity to protect the safe and reliable operation of the power grid serving the state. In January, the Attorney General charged Pacific Gas \u0026 Electric Corp. with illegal, unfair and fraudulent business practices that drove its California utility into bankruptcy after siphoning over $4 billion from the subsidiary and violated promises to the state to protect California ratepayers., 3730\u003dThe Attorney General\u0027s complaint filed with FERC also challenges short-term sales of energy to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), which spent an estimated $10 billion for electricity on the \"spot market\" from January through October 2001 to keep the lights on in California. Although DWR paid grossly inflated prices for power, FERC has refused to take any action to refund overcharges on these sales. The Attorney General\u0027s complaint demands that FERC order refunds to the extent that any rate charged was unjust and unreasonable. In separate action, the California Public Utilities Commission has sought to have FERC find that the prices paid under the state\u0027s long-term contracts are unreasonable., 5260\u003dThe new complaint filed with FERC challenges all power sales into markets administered by the California Independent System Operator (ISO) and the California Power Exchange during the energy crisis in the state going back before October 2, 2000. FERC already has ordered refunds on energy purchases between October 2, 2000 and June 21, 2001. Experts estimate that rates charged before October 2001 exceeded just and reasonable levels by $1.8 to $2.8 billion.

The protocol described above for receiving broadcast messages is summarized in FIG. 4 (Bcast cntr\u003dbroadcast countdown counter). It has the advantage that PS Stations only need to be awake during the broadcast period, enabling them to save power. The broadcast period is longer than the time required for the Control Point to send its buffered messages; during this period any station can send broadcast messages and there is no need for the Control Point to buffer and re-send those messages, improving utilisation of the wireless medium. If a PS station has woken up for the broadcast period and does not receive a CPB, then it should remain awake until it receives a CP Beacon, at which point it can determine whether it should remain awake or go back to sleep. If a PS station receives a CPB in which the broadcast flag is not set it can immediately go to sleep until the start of the next broadcast period. If a PS station receives a CPB in which the broadcast flag is set it should remain awake to receive broadcast messages. The PS station should remain awake until it receives a CPB in which the broadcast flag is not set. To receive broadcast messages a PS station should notify the Control Point","textAfterTable":"US20100008279 * 14 Jan 2010 Beom Jin Jeon Method for managing the power in the wireless network US20110161697 * 30 Jun 2011 Qi Emily H Method and system for discoverability of power saving p2p devices US20110182276 * 28 Jul 2011 Research In Motion Limited Methods And Apparatus For Reducing Power Consumption For Mobile Devices Using Broadcast-To-Unicast Message Conversion US20120287835 * 15 Nov 2012 Lg Electronics Inc.

{"relation":[["Name","Basal cell carcinoma","Squamous cell carcinoma","Malignant melanoma"],["Description","Basal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 80 percent of all skin cancers. This highly treatable cancer starts in the basal cell layer of the epidermis (the top layer of skin) and grows very slowly. Basal cell carcinoma usually appears as a small, shiny bump or nodule on the skin - mainly those areas exposed to the sun, such as the head, neck, arms, hands, and face. It most commonly occurs among people with light-colored eyes, hair, and complexion.","Squamous cell carcinoma, although more aggressive than basal cell carcinoma, is highly treatable. It accounts for about 20 percent of all skin cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as nodules or red, scaly patches of skin, and may be found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, ears, lips, and mouth. However, if left untreated, squamous cell carcinoma can spread to other parts of the body. This type of skin cancer is usually found in fair-skinned people.","Malignant melanoma accounts for a small percentage of all skin cancers, but accounts for most deaths from skin cancer. Malignant melanoma starts in the melanocytes - cells that produce pigment in the skin. Malignant melanomas sometimes begin as an abnormal mole that then turns cancerous. This cancer may spread quickly. Malignant melanoma most often appears on fair-skinned men and women, but people with all skin types may be affected."]],"pageTitle":"NewYork-Presbyterian/Queens - Skin Cancer","title":"","url":"http://www.nyhq.org/diw/Content.asp?PageID\u003dDIW001560\u0026language\u003dChinese","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"MIXED","tableType":"RELATION","tableNum":0,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438043058631.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002418-00006-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":637889499,"recordOffset":637869800,"tableOrientation":"HORIZONTAL","TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable":"{512\u003dSkin cancer is a malignant tumor that grows in the skin cells.

Certain moles are at higher risk for changing into malignant melanoma.

Recognizing changes in moles, by following this ABCD Chart, is crucial in detecting malignant melanoma at its earliest stage.

This, however, did backfire as Madara released his contract with the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation to carry out the final phase of his plan, seeing his reincarnation as an unfortunate substitute of the intended resurrection which Nagato was supposed to do.

recovery schemes disclosed herein improve video quality under lossy Internet environments by focusing on removing error propagation associated with motion-compensated video coding. To evaluate the effectiveness of these schemes, performance of these schemes is measured under varying network conditions produced by actual Internet traces. The performance is then compared to the performance of existing solutions, such as RPS and Intra-H.261, which address the error propagation problem. In the performance evaluation, three H.263 anchor video sequences produced by an H.263 codec available from Telenor, one for each of MPEG-4 class A, B and E tests, are compared. The three video sequences are described in Table 1., 116168\u003dTo emulate the loss behavior encountered in the Internet, 12 minute video transmissions were collected over a trans-pacific connection every hour for a two-week period. The frame rate was set to 10 frames per second. Full-search motion estimation and the image size of CIF (352?288 color) were used for all experiments. The default quantization step of 8 was used. A video frame was first compressed using a RESCU codec, which was built using an implementation of H.261. The video frame was then packetized into approximately 256-byte packets, such that the individual packets contain an integral number of macroblocks., 123495\u003dThe adaptiveness of lazy hybrid RESCU is clearly visible when it adapts the amount of repair overhead to maintain high quality under varying network conditions. From the first graph, it can be observed that that the video quality of the RESCU scheme drops when packet loss occurs. However, the video quality immediately bounces back and generally sustains good quality with PSNRs between 35 dB and 40 dB. Around frames 200-450, frames 700-1350, frames 2200-2400, and frames 2600-2800, the trace experiences high packet losses. During these times, it can be observed that the bit rate increases beyond 225 kbits/sec, which is the result of increased repair traffic. During the other times, the bit rate drops to around 180 kbits/sec which is approximately the same bit rate as H.261. This is because during heavy loss periods, FEC packets are not enough to recover from losses, and retransmission is used more often. Since during quiescent periods, retransmission does not occur and only a small number of FEC packets are added, the bit overhead drops to minimum. These results combined with the results presented in the previous sections indicate that lazy RESCU is able to adapt to varying network conditions to minimize bit overhead while sustaining good video quality., 41384\u003dThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/079,621 filed May 15, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,104,757, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, 116807\u003dA wide range of round-trip times (RTT) (from about 250 ms to over 1000 ms), and loss rates (from 0.5% to 18%) were observed. The mean loss burst length is less than 3. Most of loss bursts are short. Occasionally, long loss bursts involving more than 100 packets are also seen. Out of about 200 traces obtained, 10 representative traces covering a spectrum of (mean) loss rate and round trip time were selected. Table 5 summarizes the average traffic characteristics observed in the selected transmission traces.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations It will be understood that various details of the invention may be changed without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation―the invention being defined by the claims. The integration of rate control schemes for RESCU has not been investigated as it is outside of the primary scope of the embodiments described herein. RESCU can be extended to incorporate rate control schemes (e.g. frame rate reduction, quantization step-size adjustment etc.) that can reduce bit rate in times of packet losses so that congestion is not aggravated by increased overhead of protecting video frames. The simulations described herein designed based on actual Internet transmission tests illustrate that these dynamic hybrid recovery schemes provide better performance than existing error-resilient schemes, both in terms of video quality and bit rate. Even in a high motion video sequence when the performance gains of both the hybrid techniques is much attenuated, they nonetheless show better overall performance when compared to RPS and Intra-H.261. Two dynamic hybrid recovery schemes have been described herein: The first is exhaustive hybrid RESCU, in which the sender finds minimum PDTT that incurs smallest bit overhead, and also satisfies a desired recovery probability of a periodic frame. In order to be able to meet the desired threshold, the PTDD should be long enough to accommodate anticipated repair attempts and the","textAfterTable":"US8462847 28 Jan 2011 11 Jun 2013 Cisco Technology, Inc.

15 illustrates the two dimensional spatial layouts of an example subcell design, C 174, to show the overlap processing of block 355 of the present invention. As shown, subcell design C 174 contains two child subcell designs C1 176 and C2 178 that overlap with a third, unrecognized, subcell design C3 180. For parent subcell design C 174, block 355 of the present invention, identifies overlap region 1010 between subcell designs C3 180 and C2 178 and also identified overlap area 1020 between subcell designs C3 180 and C1 176. Local structure 1030 is also shown. Subcell design C 174 is divided into a two dimensional array of bins 1050 of arbitrary size; a portion 1055 of this array is shown in FIG. 15. Overlap is determined by searching each respective bin of a parent subcell and recording the whether or not a child subdesign is within the respective bin. A bin 1050 of the parent is part of the overlap area if (1) it has more than one child subdesign found therein or (2) it has at least one child subdesign and local structure 1030 found therein., 98648\u003dAt step 545 of FIG. 6B, the geometry data represented by the overlap database 360 is then passed through the netlist extraction block 365. At block 365, the present invention obtains the physical netlist of the overlap areas including all connectivity information; this determined information is then placed into the physical netlist 370 for the LVS checker 375. For instance, if subcell C3 overlaps subcell C2 and C1 (FIG. 15) at portions 1010 and 1020, then the netlist extraction block 365 determines the connectivity information of portions 1010 and 1020 with reference to subcells C1, C2 and C3. This information is then stored in the physical netlist 370., 97784\u003dSecondly, at step 530 of FIG. 6A, only those portions of the subcell designs that are overlapping, as determined at step 530, are then flattened by block 355. This is advantageous because by performing selective flattening only on these overlapping portions, the geometry data required for layout verification is reduced. A description of the selective flattening process of step 530 is found in the incorporated co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/940,354, filed on Sep. 30, 1997 and entitled SELECTIVE FLATTENING IN LAYOUT AREAS IN COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN, attorney docket SNSY-A1997-032, by Ho and Tang and assigneed to the assignee of the present invention. Once the geometry data corresponding to the identified overlap regions has been flattened, it is represented in the overlap database 360 of FIG. 4B., 95945\u003dA description of the overlap determination processes of step 525 of FIG. 6A is found in the incorporated co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/940,162, filed on Sep. 30, 1997 and entitled LAYOUT OVERLAP DETECTION WITH SELECTIVE FLATTENING IN COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN, attorney docket SNSY-A1997-033, by Ho and Tang and assigneed to the assignee of the present invention. The areas of overlap of each subcell design are logged into a special overlap file maintained within block 355. Optionally, at step 525, each parent subdesign can be checked for any cell overlap whether or not the overlap involves a new or unrecognized cell. This can be performed in an alternative embodiment of the present invention.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations The preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system for performing layout verification that reuses previously validated subcell designs, is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the below claims. Conclusion FIG. 14A, FIG. 14B and FIG. 14C illustrate certain design rules checked by the design rule checker 425 of the present invention for CMOS via2 regions, metal3 and overglass regions, respectively. FIG. 14A illustrates spacings for via2 and 894 is the exact size (2?2 lambda), 900 is the minimum space (3 lambdas), 898 is the minimum overlap by metal2 (1 lambda) and 896 is the minimum spacing to vial (2 lambdas). FIG. 14B illustrates spacings for metal3 and 902 is the minimum width (6 lambdas), 904 is the minimum spacings (4 lambdas) and 906 is the minimum overlap of via2 (2 lambdas). FIG. 14C illustrates the spacings for overglass in microns where 910 is 100?100, space 914 is 6 microns, 908 is 30 microns and 912 is 15 microns. As stated previously, the design rule checker 425 checks each of the above spacings/widths within its received geometry data and reports errors for any measurements that are not satisfied. FIG. 13A, FIG. 13B and FIG. 13C illustrate certain design rules checked by the design rule checker 425","textAfterTable":"US20040076895 * 14 Oct 2003 22 Apr 2004 Numerical Technologies, Inc.

(string “Jan. 10, 1997??)), 203160\u003dThe advisory 40139 which we released on May 31, 1998 has been recalled, and we recommend that you delete it from your advice system immediately., 122334\u003dThe intent of this fragment is that Photoshop PlugIn is a property of the World which takes an extra string parameter and returns an object of type Photoshop PlugIn. If the Photoshop PlugIn named PictureEnhancer cannot be found by the method implementing the Photoshop PlugIn property, then the result is a non-existent object, for which modification time is not an allowed property, and evaluation fails. If the Photoshop PlugIn named PictureEnhancer is found, then modification time, being an allowable property of a Photoshop PlugIn, leads to invocation of a method which returns an object of type time. This result is compared with the result of subexpression time “10 January 1997??, Here, time refers to a property of World which takes an extra string parameter and returns an object of type time. If evaluation succeeds, the result of this whole expression is Boolean: either True or False., 109710\u003dIn the currently understood best method for structuring advice for Internet transport, an advisory document is packaged as a single ASCII text file which is a valid instance of MIME file (see N. Borenstein, N. Freed, MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies, Internet Standards Track RFC 1521 (1993)). Actually, only a special subset of the full MIME format is used. Special extensions to MIME are added to accommodate the invention., 213961\u003dAn Air Ticket consolidator purchases a block of 50 seats on a flight from New York to London for August 20. The consolidator wants to resell those seats to travelers. The consolidator maintains a relationship with a variety of travel agents., 174889\u003dAs an example of how such an inspector is used, suppose that in January 1998 a special piece of patch code was released which modified the application Graphmaker. Suppose that most consumers who installed this patch learned of it through the advisory process described herein. It is desired to reach users running the application GraphMaker which at some point in the past, prompted by an advisory, had installed the patch to the Graphmaker application. Suppose this is because an improved version of the patch has become available., 81638\u003dA computer-intelligible component which potentially offers either software tools to solve the problem or Internet access to software tools solving the problem. In the currently understood best method for this implementation, an advisory is a specially formatted ASCII file built using the MIME Internet standards track specification documented in RFC 1521 et seq. (see N. Borenstein, N. Freed, MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies, Internet Standards Track RFC 1521(1993)). This format is currently used for transport of Internet mail; it contains headers documenting the sender of the message and its subject, and mechanisms for including digital signatures. A MIME file is easily transported over the Internet and is easily broken into its constituent components using parsing algorithms well-known in the Internet community. The advisory file format is described further below (see, also A Guide to Writing Advisories for AdviceNet, Universe Communications, Inc., Berkeley, Calif. (1998))., 378340\u003dOne technique to further consumer acceptance is for a privacy ratings service at a central site to certify questionnaires as being in accord with privacy standards when they are appropriate implementations of the randomized response protocol. Under existing Web protocols (see Khare, Rohit (1997) Digital Signature Label Architecture, The World Wide Web Journal, Summer 1997, Vol. 2, Number 3, pp. 49-64, Oreilly, Sebastopol, Calif., http://www.w3.org/DSIG) there is a method for the establishment of ratings services which can reliably certify that certain messages have certain properties. The credibility of such assertions, i.e. that they are actually made by the service and not by an impostor, is based on deployment of standard authentication and encryption devices. Applying this technology, a privacy ratings service is established at a central site, e.g. Better Advice Bureau.org, to certify that certain questionnaires gather information in a fashion generally accepted as appropriate for the advertised task, and the information is used by the solicitor in a manner to protect individual identity. Advice authors seeking certification of the privacy respecting character of their questionnaires submit those messages to the certification authority, which studies the messages and, at its option, agrees to certify some of those messages as privacy respecting. In one embodiment of the invention, the user interface of the advice reader or similar component is configured to permit questionnaires to be displayed to users only when they have been credibly certified by a trusted privacy ratings service., 32342\u003dThis application claims benefit to U.S. provisional No. 60/098,798 filed Sep. 1, 1998., 136397\u003dIn the currently understood best method of implementing the invention, procedural services are not made available in the relevance language. As inspection of the above grammar description shows the language has:, 114043\u003dDate: Sat Mar. 21, 1998 17:06:12 +0800, 126689\u003dParsing proceeds mechanically according to a precedence table giving the productions of a grammar. In the currently understood best method, the productions in the grammar are as follows:, 357431\u003dIn this context, if someone wants to warn every user receiving mail from king@athens.gr with an attachment named trojan.txt that he should not open the attachment, it is possible to author a relevance clause targeting the advisory to those people about to open such an attachment. The routing of advisories to advice event pools is handled through the header line mechanism of MIME and the message line variations discussed above. A simple header line of the form advice-event-pool:, followed by the name of a predefined advice event, indicates the desired routing., 123621\u003dIn the currently understood best-method, the relevance language is implemented as a context free grammar which can be automatically parsed into a tree of subexpressions. The tree of subexpressions can be understood as an abstract structure whose nodes are methods and whose branches are subexpressions., 128750\u003dA grammar can be used to generate a parser by any of several means (see A. Aho, J. Ullman, Principles of Compiler Design, Addison-Wesley (1977)). These may include automatic parser generators, such as YACC, which create a table driven finite state automaton that recognizes the grammar. The table is created directly from the production forms above, and also by hand generation of recursive descent parsers based on mimicking the productions of the grammar in modules whose naming and internal structure mimic the structure of the productions of the grammar., 376939\u003dModel: T1200, 229875\u003dBreak-ins: Kevin Mitnick. Over a period of years Mitnick used the Internet systematically to break into computers worldwide, and he managed deliberately to cause some to crash or to lose data permanently. While it is supposed that Mitnick was some sort of evil genius the truth is that sites on the Internet give instructions on how to break into Pentagon computers. A Pentagon led experiment in 1997 showed that using publicly available information one could, in fact, access classified DOD computers and cause permanent damage to files., 125313\u003dmodification time of Photoshop PlugIn “Picture Enhancer?? is greater than time “Jan. 10, 1997??, 230815\u003dWorms: Robert Morris, Jr. In a well-known 1988 episode, Morris released a worm which spread rapidly across the Internet, installing itself in many machines, and while in execution on those machines, spread itself to other machines. In fact, Morris was attempting no more than a prank. The rapid and pervasive spread of the worm surprised him, as did the enormous amount of time required to eradicate the worm and regain full capabilities of the affected computers. The powerfully disruptive nature of the worm was caused by its ability to spread automatically, and run automatically on whatever machine it reached. This case dramatizes the risks that can arise through the automatic spreading of executable code across the Internet. (Pfleeger, Security in computing, Prentice Hall 1996), 122190\u003drelevant-When: modification time of Photoshop PlugIn “Picture Enhancer?? is greater than time “10 January 1997 12:34:56+0800??}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the claims included below. The logical structure described is that of a single body of advisories evaluated for relevance in a collection of different contexts, where the results in all those different contexts are gathered together in one single master user interface. This logical structure makes sense in other settings. For example, in the example of drug interactions discussed above, the pharmacist is an administrator, the body of advisories that he has received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are a body to be applied in many different contexts, and each of his customers database records provide a unique context for interpretation of the advisories. Here, the context is not of individual machines but individual records in a database. The master user interface is the basis for another variation of the invention, i.e. operating with a specialized database inspector, the master advice reader obtains a list of all the patients for each advisory for whom a given advisory is relevant. The user interface displays only master-relevant information to the pharmacist, i.e. advisories relevant for some patient in the database. The pharmacist then views the relevant advisories and inspects a","textAfterTable":"Aug 27, 2004 Sep 11, 2007 Microsoft Corporation System and method for enhancing a server\u0027s ability to withstand a “SYN flood?? denial of service attack US7328241 * Jan 4, 2002 Feb 5, 2008 International Business Machines Corporation Dynamic visualization of electronic mail propagation US7346655 * Feb 12, 2001 Mar 18, 2008 Bigfix, Inc.

Personages[bewerken] Aan het eind van de serie durft Yusaku eindelijk de stap te wagen en Kyoko ten huwelijk te vragen. Bij aanvang van het verhaal gaat de vorige huisbaas van het huis, Ikkoku, met pensioen, en maakt Kyoko tot de nieuwe eigenaar. Yusaku wordt meteen verliefd op haar, maar door het gedrag van de andere huurders heeft hij moeite dit aan haar bekend te maken. Hij probeert meerdere malen haar zijn gevoelens te vertellen, maar wordt altijd gestoord of verkeerd begrepen. Dit heeft meer dan eens een kort maar fel gevecht tot gevolg. Yusaka krijgt bovendien concurrentie van Kyoko\u0027s coach Shun Mitaka, die graag met haar wil trouwen. De manga is een romantische komedie over een groep mensen die allemaal kamers hebben gehuurd in een pand in het Tokio van de jaren 80. De serie draait vooral om de relatie tussen Yusaku Godai, een arme student, en Kyoko Otonashi, de jonge eigenaresse van het huis die pas weduwe is geworden.

relatively high draw down is conducted as the fiber is extruded. This orients the fiber at or near the spinneret die face rather than in a subsequent operation. The drawdown significantly reduces the cross-sectional area of the fibers yet surprisingly without losing the profile imparted by the spinneret orifice. The draw down is generally at least 10:1, preferably at least 50:1, and more preferably at least about 100:1, with draw downs significantly greater than this possible. For these draw down rates, the cross-section of the fiber will be diminished directly proportional to the drawdown ratio.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations The various modifications and alterations of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, and this invention should not be restricted to that set forth herein for illustrative purposes. For certain patents, it is uncertain if the figures are completely accurate representations of the fibers formed by these patents, however it is reasonable to assume that these are at least valid approximations. As can be seen, none of the comparative example fibers retain the shape of the die orifices to the degree of Examples 1, 2, 6-9 or 12 as represented by SRF, SRF2 and the percent open area. In certain of these comparative examples (i.e., GB 1,292,388, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,772,137 and 4,179,259), the open area is calculated by excluding area completely circumscribed by the fiber in the cross-section.

{"relation":[["Date","3 years 46 weeks ago","3 years 46 weeks ago"],["Title","true religion kinder Mission Impossible","Tory Burch Heels Mistaken Myths"],["Body","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Jim Phelps goes to a specified place and time and finds an envelope and tape recorder and presses the play button. \"Good morning Mr Phelps. With the cold war seemingly dead and buried and, the west too caught up in the political diplomatic ties of the war on terror to care about Russian views and their current weapon development on the Russian/Polish border. You are looking at pictures taken from one of our satellite cameras in space of earthwork developments being created to support an industrial scanner situated in an underground vault that the Polish state government have reportedly complained is breaching their own territory in several areas. The head of the home division of the KGB, Wilhyame Hansen, has recently taken over a town close to the Polish border to oversee the area and is in constant contact with his guards positioned right up to the border with Poland and, as reported, within Poland itself to try and stop anyone getting too close to whatever works Russia has on-going in that sensitive border area. Your mission Jim, should you decided to accept it, is to breach Russia\u0027s border and discover what this scanner is being used for and report its location and plans to the authorities as soon as possible. Of course, if you or any of your group are caught or killed, the secretary will disavowal any knowledge of your actions. This tape will self destruct in five seconds. Good luck Jim.\" Jim stopped the tape and watched it smoke and fizzle away. Back at Jim\u0027s apartment, he walks out of the kitchen and moved over to his sofa and sat down. He now grabbed the IMF folder and went through it and picked out the usual operatives and then sat back pleased with his choice. Within days, his team had met up with him in his apartment and he explained the plan to discover the secret of Russia\u0027s scanner and just what they were planning that close to Poland. Jim had found a hotel thirty miles from the area that was under scrutiny and his team checked in to this hotel as separately as they could to not raise any suspicions. Jim pulled into the car park of this hotel just as an American family had arrived. Jim was pulling out his suitcase from the trunk of his car just as the children of this family started to run around the car park screaming. One of the children from this family noticed Jim and moved up to him. \"Don\u0027t tell me, you\u0027re American, right?\" The child said looking at him. Jim looked around at the three other children still running around the car park screaming and, then to the girl in front of him. \"I beg your pardon.\" \"Your clothes, the airport business car, I\u0027d say defiantly American.\" The child said folding her arms around her in a protective manner. Jim watched this then bent down and grabbed his case and looked back at the child and raised a smile towards her. \"Yes, I\u0027m American, like yourself and,\" He now looked at her parents trying to grab the rest of their family. \"As are you and, the other members of your family, hmm?\" He said finishing on looking at her. She now stepped back slightly. \"I\u0027m Claira, Claira Reese.\" She said then stepped forward to hold out her hand. Jim looked at her small hand and then shook it and then looked at her beaming at him. \"I\u0027m Jim, Jim Phelps.\" \"Are you staying at this hotel? I mean, of course you\u0027re staying at this hotel. Err, I mean, what would you be doing here if you wasn\u0027t?\" She said looking down to her feet. Jim laughed. \"Yes, I am staying here at this hotel although I haven\u0027t made up my mind for how long, yet.\" \"Claira!\" Her mother said behind her. \"Would you mind not going up to everyone and asking them what they are doing here? The poor man is probably on holiday to relax or something, just like us.\" \"No, he\u0027s not on holiday mum, Mr Phelps is on business here, isn\u0027t that right Mr Phelps?\" Claira said looking back to him. \"Well, I...\" He stopped as Claira\u0027s mother pulled her back from Jim. \"I\u0027m so sorry if my daughter has upset you Mr, what did you say you\u0027re name was?\" \"Mum, I said his name was Mr Phelps and I don\u0027t think he minds me talking to him. Do you Mr Phelps?\" \"It\u0027s Jim and no, I do not mind you talking to me, in a hotel car park of all places.\" He added looking around. \"See, you\u0027ve insulted him, come along Claira, I will not ask again.\" Her mother said pulling her away. Jim watched as Claira was pulled back to the rest of her family by her mother. He shook his head and slowly went into the hotel and signed himself in. Jim managed to get a room down the hall from the family and made himself comfortable as he waited for the rest of his team to sign in and get allocated separate rooms. That evening his team met up and Jim got on with the rest of his briefing from within his room where Barney would be making a tunnel of his own to run along with the Russian version to find out exactly why the Russian\u0027s have been breaching the Polish border and why. \"It would be a good idea to find out what the Russians have at the border on a daily basis.\" Jim said looking at the map. \"How are you expecting to work that one out? I mean they will not allow you to just walk up to the border and ask them to view their plans right there and then.\" Rollin said showing him the exact border guard layout. \"I have been working on that one Rollin. I guess you can put this one down to a family that I met in the hotel car park earlier today. I\u0027m just a businessman that has a few days to spare around the border gates. Who says that I can\u0027t be just a little curious in a tourist\u0027s kind of way? Rollin, take this mobile phone and call me when you go on guard duty.\" Jim said handing him a phone. \"I get it. When I call I just happen to forget that the gate is unmanned for a while.\" Rollin said checking the phone. \"I just need to wait for your call.\" Jim now headed down to the hotel\u0027s restaurant to check out the local Polish cuisine. He started to get buried into the pages of choices available. \"If you want to wake up in morning like you did this morning, I suggest you stay away from the main menu and try the side meals, you\u0027d be safer that way\" Jim moved the large menu away from his face and focused in on Claira holding the other menu in her hand. \"Claira.\" He said taking the menu from her. \"Thank you, I\u0027ll try that.\" He added checking the menu. Claira now looked back then jumped up onto the seat across from him. \"Hide me, quick!\" She said ducking in next to him. Jim watched her move up next to him and buries her head into his side. \"Claira, what are you doing?\" \"My dad, I bet he\u0027s been looking for me all afternoon.\" \"Why, what have you done now?\" \"Nothing Mr Phelps, honest, I...\" She stopped and watched her father walk past Jim\u0027s table. Jim now looked up to see the rest of Claira\u0027s family sail past. He now looked at Claira with her head into his side. \"You know their probably worried about you.\" \"You think? My mum and dad are, well ever since...\" She looked down. A waiter now appeared next to Jim waiting for his order. Jim looked at Claira now checking her parents seating area. \"Could you send four sausage sandwiches and a bottle of pop to room 454 and add it to my bill. Is that alright, Claira?\" He said looking over to her. \"Hur, sandwiches?\" \"You think that you can handle a couple of sandwiches?\" Claira looked at Jim then at the waiter. \"Yeah, yeah.\" The waiter marked his pad then left them alone. \"Come with me.\" He said moving out of the seat and allowing Claira out. \"Where are we going?\" \"Back to my room.\" \"Oh no, I can\u0027t.\" \"Why not?\" \"My mum and dad told me that I shouldn\u0027t go with strangers.\" Jim stopped and looked at her. \"Strangers?\" \"Yes, mum said...\" \"Did she? Strangers, indeed.\" He said taking her hand and leading her out and up to his room. Within a few minutes or so a waiter arrived with Jim\u0027s order and brought it into the room as Claira sat on the sofa watching Jim sign for it and letting the waiter out. \"Right, let\u0027s see if this kills us or not.\" He said lifting up the tray to reveal four freshly cooked sausage sandwiches. \"Wow cool, can I?\" She said moving forward in her seat. \"Of course, and the drink is yours too as I have my own drink cabernet. \"I guessed you would have. My dad has the same set up just down the hall but, I think mum uses it as well.\" She said grabbing a sandwich and sitting back in the chair munching. Jim grabbed a sandwich and went up to the drinks cabernet to make himself a drink then moved back to the sofa and sat down to grab his plans to check over them again. Claira snuck in next to him and watched him reading the plan. \"What have you got there?\" She said pointing to the folder. \"It\u0027s private. No fear Claira but, you may think that falling out with your mum and dad is the number one priority around here but to me that doesn\u0027t even come close. I\u0027m just keeping you here to make sure you don\u0027t go and do something stupid while you\u0027re not on speaking terms. Besides, I left word at the reception to inform your parents exactly where you are.\" \"You what?\" Claira said looking at him. \"You really think I would help you over a \u0027whatever\u0027 in your life just because I\u0027m a fellow American whom you just decided might be around to cover your ass when you\u0027re parents have it number one on their spanking lists? I\u0027ve seen kids like you many times before and you are not going to get one over me like you do with your parents.\" Claira looked at him then there was a knock on the door. \"Ah, there you go.\" He said putting his file down and moving to the door and opening it to find Claira\u0027s mother and father standing there. \"Oh Jim, thank you so much for telling us where Claira was, I really thought we wouldn\u0027t have any problems with her this trip but, I guess, we were aiming our inspirations to high again. Come on along Claira; thank Mr Phelps for taking the time to look after you.\" Her mother said coaxing Claira towards her. Claira looked at Jim as she reached the door. \"Thank you so much, Mr Phelps.\" She said sarcastically. \"Here,Tory Burch Flats, don\u0027t forget your dinner, I mean,Nike Shox R2 Schuhe, it was the least I could do.\" He said handing her the tray platter and her bottle of pop. Claira made a fake grin and followed her parents down the hall looking back to Jim waving her goodbye. He then went back inside his room and laughed. The next day Jim met up with his team again and Barney had managed to secure some sensitive equipment that would be able to obtain precise measurements and graphic detail of Russia\u0027s movements. \"How close would we have to be in making this work properly Barney?\" Jim said checking the equipment was working fine. \"After the first initial programming, I would be able to take this machine straight into the main tunnel.\" \"Where would we have to be for the initial programming?\" \"I\u0027d say, between three and five hundred yards, either way of the border, to be certain of a proper reading being obtained.\" Barney said looking towards Jim. \"Three hundred yards in daylight before you can use this in the tunnels?\" Jim said looking at him. \"To, at least get this to read and work properly the way we want it, yes.\" Barney said looking back to the machine. \"Alright, I\u0027ll contact you when this is ready for you.\" Jim packed up the machine and left it by the door ready for him to put into his car and head towards the border. The next morning Jim came down with the machine and went out to his car and put the machine in the boot and then went back into the hotel to have some breakfast and studied the local maps for a route up to the border crossing. He looked across to see Claira walking in behind her two sisters and brother with her parents bringing up the rear. Jim sipped at his coffee as he watched the family sit down and again making their parents life hell as they all went through the breakfast menu as loudly as they could. Jim soon finished his breakfast and moved out to the reception and then out into the car park. He got into his car and noticed Claira running out of the hotel and across the car park. Claira made it to a big tree by the entrance of the hotel. Jim started up his engine and drove over to her and caught her attention. She now moved away. \"Claira!\" He said calling over to her. \"Go away!\" Jim looked away then turned off the engine and jumped out of his car and moved up to her. \"Are you still mad at me because I called your parents to tell them where you were last night?\" Claira did not answer him and moved away. Jim looked back to his car. \"Look, I\u0027m heading up to the border for the morning.\" \"Good, bon voyage.\" \"Claira, you don\u0027t mean that.\" \"Yes I do, after all what do you know about me?\" \"Nothing but, if you\u0027re interested in a drive with me, I won\u0027t tell your parents where you are this time.\" \"Oh whoopee, let\u0027s get the flags out for that one.\" She said looking back. \"Okay, well I don\u0027t want you saying I didn\u0027t ask.\" He said getting back into his car as Claira looked back. \"See you later, Claira.\" He added starting up his engine and starting to move away. Claira looked towards him then jumped out in front of him. \"Wait!\" She said allowing him to pull up next to her and she opened the rear passenger side door and got in. \"I don\u0027t do this for anyone you know.\" She said closing the door. \"I\u0027ll keep reminding myself that as we go.\" He said looking at her through the rear view mirror as Jim drove off following his map drawings to the Polish Russian border. Claira looked around as Jim got closer to the border as a lot of heavy plant machinery was moving around the whole area. Claira jumped forward as the border now appeared. \"Wow, this is some border.\" Jim looked at her as he pulled off to a private car park. \"I want you to stay here for a while.\" Jim said as he got out. Claira quickly jumped out. \"Don\u0027t leave me here.\" She said grabbing Jim\u0027s hand. \"Claira, I\u0027m not going to leave you anywhere. I just need to do something on my own and I would like you to wait for me in the car.\" \"But...\" \"Claira, I need you to trust me again and this time; I\u0027m not going to let you down. Just stay there.\" Jim said closing the door and he moved back towards the boot and opening it up to reveal the machine. Claira noticed other people in the car park moving around. \"Is there any problem with us being at the border, Jim?\" She said noticing some official men. Jim was too engrossed in the workings of the machine. \"Jim, can you hear me?\" She said moving further back into the seat. \"Hur, sweetheart?\" \"Can I ask what your business at the border today is, Mr?\" A guard said moving around the car. Jim looked up and over to the guard who had now noticed Claira in the back seat. This gave Jim the chance to lock the boot and move away from it as the guard now looked at him. \"Jim Phelps.\" He said looking at the guard. \"Dad?\" Claira said as she moved over to the other side of the car to get out. The guard now noticed her and grabbed his gun. \"Now wait a minute. She\u0027s a kid, and she\u0027s just scared, that\u0027s all. How do you expect her to behave when she see\u0027s you coming towards me?\" Claira ran to the front of the car and looked around for the exit. \"Dad?\" She again said trying to get her way out of the situation. Jim and the guard looked at her. \"Excuse me. My daughter needs me.\" Jim said as the guard reluctantly stepped aside and watched Jim head to the front of the car and grabbed her. \"Sweetheart its okay daddies\u0027 right here.\" He said touching her. Claira now looked at him and allowed Jim to hug her. \"Dad.\" \"It\u0027s alright, I\u0027m right here.\" He said kissing her. The guard now went up to them. \"I asked you what you were doing at the border today. You have no business reason to be here.\" \"We wanted to see the border. Well, I guess I wanted to see the border.\" Claira said looking at him. \"And wherever my daughter wants to go then I will duly take her.\" Jim added looking at Claira as they both agreed and looked at the guard. \"You are an American businessman on work here for a local conglomerate financial team. You and your daughter have a room at the international hotel thirty miles from the here.\" \"That\u0027s right. This is my business car and I have all my legal documents in the glove box, if you would like me to show them to you.\" Jim said moving to open the driver\u0027s door. \"That is not necessary. All the information we require was forwarded to us some weeks ago,p90x RevAbs, otherwise you wouldn\u0027t have been able to stay anywhere near this sensitive area. Jim watched the guard check the car. \"What were you doing in the boot of this vehicle when I first approached you?\" The guard said heading for it. \"My daughter was tired. I was just getting her a blanket so she could get some sleep. Claira\u0027s not one to sleep on strange beds and she finds this hired car more suitable especially when I\u0027m driving.\" Jim said moving up to him. The guard tried to open the boot. \"Open it.\" \"Alright, but all that is in there is the standard issue spare tyre, jack and.\" Jim opened the boot to reveal the blanket. \"One special blanket that my daughter uses to sleep with, as I explained.\" The guard lifted out the blanket and checked underneath. Claira now moved up to Jim and the guard and noticed the blanket. \"That\u0027s mine.\" She said grabbing the blanket from the guard and putting her head into it to smell the newness. The guard watched her do this then looked at Jim. \"Well, if there is nothing else.\" \"I have just one request from you to agree with, Mr Phelps, and that is that you do not come to this border area again. The whole area is guarded and CCTV is watching you\u0027re every turn, even at the hotel.\" He said putting down the boot and walking away from them. They watched him go and Claira stepped back into Jim and he held her. She now looked at him. \"Are you alright?\" She nodded and allowed Jim to help her into the car and put the blanket around her. Jim drove slowly back to the hotel and parked up. He looked into the back and found Claira asleep on the blanket and smiled. He got out and opened the door and gently shook her. \"Claira, Claira we\u0027re home.\" He said as Claira stirred. \"Dad?\" She said then realised where she was and sat up. \"Hur, their gonna kill me.\" She added and jumped out of his car then stopped and turned back. \"Thanks for the drive\" She said then ran off to the hotel. Jim chuckled and watched her. \"My pleasure.\" He said then looked in to see the blanket and then remembered the machine, so he grabbed the blanket and moved to the boot and opened it up. He now pressed a button in the boot as a false back fell down to reveal the machine and put the blanket back in its place. He then secured the car and headed back into the hotel and back up to his room. That evening, Jim met up with the rest of his team to discuss plans further. Barney showed exactly where he was with his tunnel and that he was now ready to work with the machine Jim had. \"Time is short here guy\u0027s. This machine will need to be calibrated just as Barney can receive it.\" Jim said checking the plans. \"Jim, I need to have a picture of the whole area or we could never prove what the Russians are planning on the border.\" \"I know Barney and I am the only one who can get those readings for you. I wasn\u0027t expecting a border crossing guard to be interested in a private car park. When Rollin is ready I will do my best to get over the border for the machine to work better but, I have to tell you now that I believe I am already being watched, especially after today and I think I may have put an innocent family in jeopardy.\" \"If that is the case, then what are you going to do about it?\" Barney said looking at him. Jim looked at him then turned away. \"I don\u0027t know how serious it is yet, but I\u0027ve got to do something for them.\" He said thinking of Claira. The next day Jim came down to breakfast late and saw Claira\u0027s mother battling to control her children as Claira stood by her and then noticed Jim and waved to him. He returned the wave then tried to attempt some breakfast. \"I have the morning paper which has been kindly translated into English, if you\u0027re planning on reading something other than a stupid book today,true religion kinder, Jim.\" Claira said as Jim looked up at her beaming at him and handed him the paper. \"Thank you.\" He said scanning the headlines. \"Mum\u0027s going to be ages sorting out my sisters and, I think my brother will be with my dad all day so, I was wondering if it was alright if I hung out with you again today Jim? I think you\u0027re business trip yesterday was fab!\" She said jumping in next to him. \"Fab?\" He said looking at her. \"Aha.\" She said looking at him. Jim folded up the paper and went back to his breakfast. Claira sat there as good as gold as everyone staying at the hotel walked past them to carry on with whatever they would be doing that day. Jim soon finished his breakfast and looked at Claira trying to get interested in the paper. \"Where\u0027s your father?\" \"Hur?\" \"Your dad, where would he be at the moment?\" \"I don\u0027t know. It all depends if they had a row this morning or not. Do you know I read a book once that said that parents are more likely to divorce six years into a marriage with children than any earlier.\" \"Where did you read that, you\u0027re parent\u0027s marriage counsellor magazine rack?\" \"How did you know that?\" She said looking at him. Jim laughed and kissed her. \"You\u0027re a good girl and I\u0027m sorry I got you involved in all this.\" He said getting up from his seat and heading out past the reception area with Claira in tow with his paper. \"You forgot your paper, dad!\" She said after him. Jim stopped and looked back. \"Thanks.\" He said as Claira drew level with him and he took the paper from him. \"Where are you going?\" \"To find you\u0027re, father.\" He said quietly as he allowed Claira to walk with him over to the lift to take them up to their floor. They walked over to her parent\u0027s room and Claira allowed Jim in to their room. \"Ah, I see Claira has found the fellow yank, as I believe my daughter has said on several occasions.\" Her father said shaking hands with Jim. Claira sank into the background as Jim and her father started to talk to each other. Later that day Jim was given the green light to approach the border where Rollin was making sure that all the guards and the important CCTV operator was not present at the time Jim needed to get the machine calibrated for Barney to use. Jim managed to complete the calibration as requested and returned to the hotel after dark where Claira had been waiting for him by the main gate entrance. Jim pulled in as Claira came running up to him. \"Hurry up Jim, I\u0027m freezing. Where\u0027s that blanket you had yesterday?\" \"In the boot.\" He said handing her the keys as Claira grabbed them from him and ran round to the boot and opened it. \"How long have you been waiting out here?\" He said taking her hand. \"I don\u0027t know. Not long, I guess.\" She said pulling out the blanket. \"Was it light when you came out?\" \"Sort of, we had lunch, I remember that.\" Jim stopped her. \"Lunch, not dinner?\" \"Of course not, that\u0027s still to come.\" Jim looked at his watch. \"Claira, its seven o\u0027clock!\" He said grabbing the blanket and wrapping her. \"Seven? He\u0027s going to kill me.\" \"If I don\u0027t first, come on.\" Jim said picking her up and carrying her into the warm hotel. \"What am I going to say to him?\" \"Start thinking.\" Jim said as they waited for the lift to arrive by the reception area. \"I know, sorry daddy I lost all track of time.\" \"That\u0027s possible sweetheart, I mean who was the one who said that time stands still around here?\" Jim said making sure everyone heard what they were saying. \"But dad, I\u0027m only saying this because I haven\u0027t got a watch.\" The lift now appeared and they walked in. \"I\u0027ll buy you a watch of your very own when we get home.\" He said kissing her as the doors closed in front of them and whisked them to their floor. \"I\u0027m not going to hear the last of this. Mum will go ballistic and dad will blame me, as usual. We\u0027ll be in counselling for years to come, hey Jim, where are we going?\" Claira said looking around. \"You can sweat it out in my room while I clear this with your father.\" \"Dad won\u0027t accept having to have another dinner just because of me.\" \"No, that\u0027s why you can stay here and have dinner with me.\" \"Good luck in trying to pursued him with mum around.\" \"Have trust in me.\" He said putting her on the sofa and putting the blanket over her. \"It will take a while for this room to get warm so keep this with you. I\u0027ll be back soon with some dinner.\" He said kissing her then went out. Jim sorted out the problem with Claira and dinner and returned to his room to find Claira asleep on the sofa so, he had some dinner while Claira slept. The next day Claira woke up on the sofa that she had fallen asleep on and looked around. Jim walked out of the bathroom and noticed she was awake. \"Good morning.\" \"What am I doing here?\" \"Well, I certainly wasn\u0027t going to take you back after you had fallen asleep.\" \"I didn\u0027t mean to sleep here last night, honest.\" \"That\u0027s nice to hear. Did you want to shower before you go down for breakfast?\" \"A shower?\" \"Your mother supplied me with some extra clothes this morning, so you\u0027re more than welcome to have a shower, because there is an hour or so before breakfast.\" He said checking his watch. She looked at him then jumped up and into the bathroom and closed the door behind her. Jim chuckled to himself and carried on getting dressed. An hour or so later Jim was leading Claira down to the restaurant area to meet the rest of her family. They got to the reception area when Claira caught sight of her parents. \"There they are. You don\u0027t mind if I go and have breakfast with them, yes.\" Claira said standing there waiting for an answer. Jim looked at her approvingly and flattened down her top. \"Go on then. Don\u0027t upset them.\" \"Upset them, me?\" She said looking at him. \"Yes, you!\" Jim said kissing her and allowing her to go to her parents for breakfast. He now took his seat in his normal way to have his breakfast and Claira spent her breakfast and part of the day with her family. Jim returned to his room and Barney met up with him to acquire the calibrated machine and he made the final plan arrangements to get the information they required and to get out with that information safely. Barney carried the machine out and to an awaiting car to take him back over the border and to start scanning the area. Jim stayed in his room and moved over to his window and noticed Claira going out for a walk with her parents and brother and sisters. Jim now started to pack and check his plane ticket home and moved his suitcase to the door when the phone started to ring and Jim looked back. An hour or so later Barney was in his makeshift tunnel heading parallel with the Russians tunnel and finally entered the sensors in to the tunnel to get a reading. An alarm now sounded in the main command room of the local KGB office at the border and a team was dispatched to the area. Jim moved back to the phone and picked it up. \"Jim it\u0027s Rollin, Barney has tripped a sensor in the command room and I haven\u0027t got the authority stopping it getting out. Their sending a team to search for him now and there\u0027s nothing I can do about it.\" Jim looked at his watch. \"Barney would have only just got there. We don\u0027t have enough time to scan anything especially if they have found out where Barney is. Get through to Barney and pull the plug.\" \"But Jim, if I can\u0027t get there in time.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me that, stop them finding Barney before I get there.\" Jim said dropping the phone and running out leaving his suitcases by the door. Jim ran out into the car park and into his car just as Claira and her family was walking back. \"Well Jim, that\u0027s the fastest I\u0027ve seen anyone run away from their hotel. Is the place on fire or something?\" Claira\u0027s father asked. \"I hope not. I still have all my clothes waiting for me. Sorry to leave you so soon, but I\u0027m needed somewhere.\" \"Don\u0027t mind us; we\u0027ve just had a nice walk out which I believe has done us the world of good.\" \"I\u0027m happy for you.\" Jim said as he got in and started up the car. \"Are you alright Jim, you look worried.\" Claira said moving to his car. \"I\u0027m fine.\" He said then sped away. They watched him leave the hotel as they walked into the reception area. It took Jim twenty minutes to get to the border area where everything was quiet on the outside. Jim pulled into the private car park under Rollin\u0027s surveillance cameras. Jim moved over to one of the areas that Barney had set up and checked it for any signs of life. Rollin now appeared from the main camp and met up with Jim. \"Where were the main guards when you last saw them?\" \"Main tunnel heading for Barney and,MBT Schuhe Damen, I don\u0027t think that he would be aware of them being around him at his position.\" Rollin said showing him pictures of the tunnels that he had caught from the CCTV cameras. Jim went back to his car and grabbed a torch. \"Stay here. If anyone comes you can handle them.\" Jim said going into the tunnel. Rollin looked around to the CCTV then back to Jim. Jim headed down the tunnel towards Russia\u0027s main tunnel as the KGB worked their way to Barney. Jim looked around for the machine that Barney would be using as he came up to his station. Barney now appeared next to him as he came out of the main tunnel. \"Jim!\" \"Barney, we\u0027ve got to pull out. The machine has been recognised and we have Russian border guards heading to this point.\" Jim said trying to collect the machine from the wall. \"I have only made one scan Jim, if we pull out of here now the world will not know what the Russians have down here. They could easily have something radioactive down here especially if they have read this machine within the hour.\" Barney said collecting the data. \"We can\u0027t take a chance not with the KGB so interested in this place. Maybe someone will be able to take these readings to someone who\u0027s interested but we\u0027ve done our job Barney, and that\u0027s all we can take from this.\" Jim said grabbing the machine and started to head out of the tunnel. \"Halt! Stand where you are!\" A guard said entering the tunnel. Rollin moved up behind him. \"It\u0027s alright soldier, I have these two.\" Rollin said moving forward. \"I\u0027m sorry sir but, my orders are to stay with anyone seen in the tunnel suspiciously.\" He said pointing his gun again. Rolling now grabbed him and pulled the guard to the floor and knocked him out. \"He must have called this in.\" Rollin said checking his gun. \"Then we have no time left. Come on!\" Jim said heading out towards his car. Jim started to load the car as a truck pulled in and some men ran down the tunnel. The guard that had seen Jim earlier in the same car recognised him and jumped out to confront him. \"You, I thought I told you not to come here again.\" He said pointing his gun at him and radioing his position. Jim now noticed him and jumped into his car as the guard did his best to stop the car. Jim did his best to get away from the hail of bullets. Jim looked back at the guard grabbing his radio. \"Their heading for the hotel, alert the guards there.\" The guard said as Jim sped away. \"Are we heading for the hotel, Jim?\" Rolling asked. \"Yes, I have my suitcases waiting for me at the door of my room.\" He said heading down the road that led only to the hotel. Back at the hotel, someone had alerted a KGB source there new exactly what he had to do. He went up to Jim\u0027s room and checked it for anything that would show what and why Jim was staying at the hotel for. After checking his room and finding nothing the man decides to set the room on fire to destroy everything of importance to Jim and then came back out and noticed Claira with her brother and sisters playing in the hallway corridor. Claira noticed him coming out of Jim\u0027s room and looked at him, so he decided to use the hallway phone to alert more men to the fact that Claira was at the hotel and not with Jim at the border and, that he needed more help to deal with her. Within minutes some more men arrived and they grabbed the children including Claira along with her parents and pilled them back into their room. As her father was arguing with one of the men over their treatment Claira managed to get out and headed back to Jim\u0027s room and the ensuing fire. Jim arrived some moments later and looked to see people rushing away from the fire which had now taken over the middle floor where Jim\u0027s room was. \"I can\u0027t see Claira anywhere. I don\u0027t even see her parents.\" \"Jim, we have to leave, the authorities will be here any minute.\" Rollin said looking on. \"I must know Claira is alright.\" He said heading for the entrance. \"Jim!\" Jim ran past the lifts and through into the stairway as the smoke became heavier. Jim moved into a toilet and wrapped a towel round his face and headed onto his floor and went towards Claira\u0027s room that she was in with her parents. He went into the smoke field room and came face to face with a blood bath of Claira\u0027s family dead in front of him. He looked around for Claira but she was not with them, so he ran back out and shouted down the corridor to no avail. Jim now took his chance and headed for his room now totally well alight. \"Claira!\" He shouted into the blackness of his room. Jim saw that his room had been trashed but he ventured as far as he dared into the room as he noticed Claira on the floor by the bathroom unconscious and with superficial burns all over her body. \"Claira!\" He repeated as he picked her up and carried her under the rising smoke and down to the reception area as the local authorities arrived to tackle the blaze. Jim moved out into the car park and Rollin run to him. \"What about her family?\" He said checking her. Jim looked at him and shook his head and then they looked at Claira. Jim, Rollin and Barney left the carnage of the hotel and headed back to the states with Claira. Jim admitted Claira to a private doctor that Rollin recommended who could help heal her burns and scars and to get her back on the road to recovery. Claira awoke some days later and looked around. She noticed a nurse checking her vital signs and guessed she was in a hospital. \"Where am I? What hospital is this? Are we still in Poland?\" She said as she realised she had a bandage on her face and hands. \"What happened?\" \"I\u0027ll get the doctor for you. I believe you\u0027re father is also waiting to hear that you\u0027re finally awake.\" \"My dad?\" She said watching the nurse go out and the door closing behind her. Claira looked at the closed door then jumped out of the bed and moved to the window and pulled the curtain to reveal the sun beating down on her face as she touched it. \"I wouldn\u0027t suggest full sun rays on that face for a few weeks yet, Miss Phelps, if you wouldn\u0027t mind returning to your bed so that I can talk to you for a moment please. I have called your father and he will be with us very shortly.\" The doctor said as a nurse moved her away from the window and back into her bed. \"Where am I?\" \"You\u0027re in a private hospital, in New York.\" The doctor said moving towards her to check her face. She leaned away from him moving any closer. \"Claira, let the doctor check your face, please sweetheart.\" Jim said behind her. \"Jim!\" She said jumping down to him and moving to his side. \"I\u0027m in New York, New York in home?\" She said looking up at him. Jim now put the flowers he had for her down and picked her up and carried her back to her bed. \"New York is your home now, yes, home.\" He said kissing her. \"Now let the doctor do his job.\" He said stepping away as the doctor approached her again. \"Is my mum behind this?\" Claira said as the doctor took off the bandages. \"Behind what?\" Jim said sorting out the flowers. \"Why you\u0027re here and not mum and dad. Did they finally get divorced or something?\" \"Miss Phelps please, you need to sit still.\" The doctor said checking her face under the light. \"Sorry.\" She said as the doctor made his notes. \"Skin pigmentation will settle into the background once the swelling reduces. I don\u0027t think there will be any problems with the fingerprints as the hands still have some time to grow and most of the burns will settle into skin lines.\" He said as the nurse started to reseal her face and hands. \"Burns, hur, I remember now! Jim there was a man who was in your room and when he came back out I noticed a fire and then these other men appeared and they grabbed my mum and dad and my brother and sisters.\" \"What happened?\" Jim said moving to her. \"They stopped me trying to do something about putting the fire out. I heard mum and dad shouting at them and I didn\u0027t know what to do. I thought that you were in the room, but you weren\u0027t. What happened, why did this man want to destroy your room?\" Jim moved up to her as the nurse finished and the doctor left them alone. \"I never asked or wanted to get you involved in this, entirely, sweetheart.\" \"Involved in what, Jim? I thought we were having fun, but I couldn\u0027t understand what was going on with the fire in your room.\" \"I have a team and I had a job to do. I guess someone at the hotel really did think that you were my daughter. I made enquiries and in the official book for the hotel your name is listed with me and not with your parents.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Claira, I believe that because you and I were seen together at the border and that you became scared and wanted your father that the guard really believed that you were my daughter.\" \"But back at the hotel the receptionists must have seen me with my brother and sisters and sometimes my mum and dad when they were talking to one another.\" She said looking at him. \"That\u0027s what I would have been led to believe but thanks to what my team and I were there for I guess that they would have forgotten that just to get at me.\" \"Well, what are you going to do now? I mean I\u0027m back at home now and my mum and dad are going to be here any minute with my brother and sisters, probably laughing at me all the here, yes?\" Claira said looking at him. \"Claira,\" He stopped and looked at her. \"You\u0027re here because I\u0027m going to take care of you from now on.\" \"Take care of me now? Well, what does mum and dad say about that?\" \"Sweetheart, you\u0027re the only one I managed to save from the fire. When I entered the hotel I found your entire family had already been shot and left for dead.\" \"Mum and dad?\" \"You\u0027re mum and dad, you\u0027re little brother and sisters too. I believe that if they would have found you first you wouldn\u0027t be sitting here now.\" \"Why didn\u0027t they kill me too?\" \"Because, I understand that you tried to find me I guess, thinking that I was in my room and they must have lost you in the smoke from the fire. I found you unconscious by the bathroom and you were in a pretty bad state with burn marks all over your face and body. I carried you out and brought you back home to the states with me and I\u0027m going to take care of you from now on.\" \"Why?\" \"Because, I feel responsible for what happened to you and, that I wasn\u0027t there to help save your family, I want to make it up to your parents by taking care of you.\" He said looking at her trying to make sense of what Jim was trying to tell her. \"Taking care of me, how?\" \"By being your father and making you a part of my team.\" He said touching her face and watching her reaction. Claira slowly looked down as she tried to make sense of everything Jim had been saying to her. \"I know this is going to be hard for you to take in. One minute you\u0027re with your family in Poland on vacation and the next you wake up here, back home alone, with me but, you\u0027re not alone.\" He said moving to touch the flowers. \"Oh, have you got children too?\" She said looking at him. \"No, as I said, I have a team that, to me are as tight as a family could ever be and, I\u0027m going to look after you Claira, have no doubt about that. You have a new face and you\u0027re fingerprints now match that of my daughter.\" He said turning to look at her. \"Wait a minute; I thought you just said you haven\u0027t got any children.\" \"If you\u0027d let me finish! I was about to say, you\u0027re fingerprints match that of my daughter, Claira Phelps.\" Claira looked at him. \"Claira Phelps.\" \"I guess that name will still sound laughable to you for a while, if not somewhat scary too.\" \"I hope that you don\u0027t expect me to call you dad over night.\" \"Of course, I shall leave that up to you, but I hope you realise that nothing will happen to you in my care. I\u0027ll make personally sure of that. When your facial scars heal the doctor said that you will then be ready to go home.\" \"Home?\" She said looking at him. \"Yes to my, our apartment here, in New York.\" He said watching her reactions. \"Well, how long will that be, exactly?\" \"I will talk with your doctor and find out exactly when. I\u0027ll see you later.\" He said then kissed her and left. Claira watched the door close then looked to the dark curtain hiding the strong summer sun and looked away thinking of her lost family as a tear fell from her eye. Please refer to Mission Impossible continued for the rest of this story. 本文???自国视科技（www.gesee.com）","Chapter One: Beware the Big Bad Wolf (and other crappy beginnings.) The sky swirled in an angry temptress portraying Violet Blacke\u0027s morbidly sarcastic personality and present anger and frustration. The Gothic church\u0027s stone pillars jutted stabbing the sky in petulant disobedience. Violet sat in the church pew listening as the priest rattled on about the light that followed death and the peace that followed the end of this chapter, and the adventure of the chapter to follow. Violet repressed a derisive snort with trouble. Not being a religious person, she found it extremely difficult to refrain from getting up and leaving. That however would not end well considering this lengthy sermon was lectured in honor of her grandmother. \"Let her family and friends be comforted in the knowledge that our dear Edith Canton will have departed her everlasting life where she will be one with God.\" Violet eyed the short balding priest cynically with a stony expression and tapped her knee impatiently with her fingers. The closed black mahogany casket lay in the middle of the aisle near her elbow. She simply wanted to leave; it almost felt as if she were locked in that dreaded dreary casket with the cold, quite dead, corpse. The congregation stood simultaneously as the priest ended the mass. \"May the Lord be with you. Mass has ended; you may go in peace.\" The organ began to wail some sorrowful haunting tune as the priest led the procession with his thick book emblazoned with curly loops of gold across the cover; the altar servers followed obediently, the heavy bedazzled golden cross carried somewhat fawningly down the aisle. Next, the four casket bearers stepped forward and lifted up the casket, each wearing a matching pin stripe suit. A sob rose from somewhere in the back of the church as the four men marched in time, heaving the encased cadaver down the center aisle. Violet reluctantly stood, her arms folded petulantly. She was supposed to lead everyone out of the looming Gothic church, being her grandmother\u0027s only living relative. Her grandfather had passed away at the young age of thirty-two and neither him, her grandmother, nor her mother had had any siblings what so ever. Her father had only one crazy sister who died a while ago; she hadn\u0027t been fit to take care of anyone, even if she were alive. Both her parents having died in a freak catastrophic car accident, she had no relatives left to speak of or take her role as the main mourner. She fixed her simple black dress with a V-neck and lacy bottom skirt and ensured that her green and black checkered pea-coat was buttoned up against the tremulous winter winds. She wore her black striped tights and clunky black lace up boots. She followed the casket as the chattering crowd trailed after her. Once everyone was outside, she watched morosely as they loaded the casket on to the long black hearse. \"You are coming for the ride, right little lady?\" the hearse driver asked with a tip of his cap revealing his white hair that was almost as blinding as the surrounding dusting of snow. \"Yes,\" she answered curtly. \"Well we should get going,\" he answered, his coal black eyes quite deadened of any spark of liveliness. Violet wondered if endless jobs at funerals resulted in this monotonous exposure and bitter exterior. He opened the passenger door, bowing slightly in an annoyed gesture that she was to sit. She slipped into the car, smoothing her dress so that it did not bunch up on the leather seats. Through her sheer black stripped tights, she could see her legs were red and chilled from the frigid temperature. The \u0027chauffeur\u0027 closed the door once she was reluctantly seated and made his way around the front of the car. He sat himself quickly, attempting to avoid the cold weather himself that seemed to snap with a deep chill, each wind was a bitter slap in the face. He turned the heat on, blasting what warmth he could throughout the vehicle. The four casket bearers squished their way in the back seat joking amiably amongst themselves and bantering jovially about some football game. The ride to the Nashua Cemetery was a quick one. Few cars followed the hearse onto the burial site, the rest hurriedly driving away as though their leave would escape her notice. The black death bed twisted its way through the endless sea of marble and slate grey gravestones. The car rolled to a stop once it reached the off-white pavilion that was erected in the back of the cemetery, closer to the woods than the actual stones, as though attempting to avoid whatever disease or sorrow had placed the unfortunates about five and a half feet under. The four men jumped out, eager to get the job done, and lugged the casket into the front center of the pavilion, stumbling through random snow drifts. They opened the lid, the hinges shrieking their protest at the unwelcomed movement. God did Violet know how they feel. She had no desire whatsoever to see the stony expression her grandmother would give in death; even as limp and lifeless as she now lay. This was all according to the instructions left in her grandmother\u0027s will. It stated there was to be a mass for her followed by an open casket wake in the cemetery\u0027s pavilion. The day would then end with a private \u0027family\u0027 burial, meaning only Violet was to be present. Violet stood at the opposite end of the pavilion as the bossy old ladies and their wistful husbands piled out of their cars. They filed into a line, the woman taking the front and the husbands standing reluctantly behind and to the side of them. Each took turns praying; kneeling in pretend humbleness before the lifeless corpse. She watched on in disgust as they leaned over the empty shell of her grandmother\u0027s body, weeping and holding her cold stiff hands. She lay like some morbid angel. Her wrinkles seemed to lessen considerably and her face was made up heavily with rose lips and soft blue lids. Her pearl rosary beads were clutched, almost desperately, in the fold of her arms. Her flowy lilac dress lilted like a dead flower and her grey curls piled on top of her head. The flabby old women with their fidgety pensive husbands stepped up to offer their condolences to Violet. She shook the men\u0027s hands reluctantly and was attacked with brusque hugs by the wives. This was an issue for her. Not only was Violet orphaned by her whole family, but she also had a problem... a mutation she liked to think of it as. She was naturally a very perceptive person, but became even more so upon the slightest touch of skin. Whenever someone\u0027s bare skin met her own, she suffered from a strange sort of \u0027out of body experience\u0027. She would embody the person; their thoughts were hers... their worries, problems, opinions, self-inflicted horrors, petulance, ignorance... you can see how this peeved her. Because of this \u0027dark gift\u0027, as her grandmother often had called it, Violet had a deep understanding of all people, and hated them for it. She had no need to know their terrible desires; no want for the knowledge of the secret sins they had stored in the deep dark crevices of their hollow, self-indulged abyss they called minds. People were bothersome; complex emotions and sinful indulgences that lead to their own heartfelt demise, it all gave her a migraine that failed to ever truly leave...as long as there were people. Animals were simple. They relied on instincts alone and for that reason she adored them. They didn\u0027t leave her mind in shambles. Their only needs: food, sleep, home, and love; they relied solely on the essentials. They did not judge or hurt for evil. This was Violet\u0027s curse, her living horror, the true reason she kept her distance from people. Let\u0027s just say, for the sake of argument (which just so happens to be her favorite pass time), the person who said relationships are built on honesty, lied. Lies shape the world, keep it spinning, keep people happy; because when you get down to the whole ugly truth, only then do hearts get broken and dreams shattered. A particular plump and wrinkled squat woman waltzed up, squeezing her in a bear hug as she simpered, \"You poor dear! I am so greatly sorry for your loss. I understand your grandmother took care of you? It must be awful!\" Translation: Haha! You are an orphan! How does it feel to know you are the soul heir of your family\u0027s blood? What a waste your family has been degraded too... And you all alone. Pity rolled off in great waves from the surrounding women, and general indifference from the men. Violet almost screamed with indignation. She barreled past the robust women, nearly knocking her on her butt as she sprinted into the cover of the dense woods. She slowed upon entering a vacant clearing, her breath ragged and harsh from the sprinting. She began to dry heave as her stomach clenched sickly. She leaned over a boulder, concentrating on deep breathing and not hurling. A twig snapped, echoing throughout the small clearing sharply as though a threat was hidden behind the obtrusive sound. She twisted around, eyes narrowed searchingly and ears strained, senses suspiciously alert for a sign of the perpetrator. A man in his thirty\u0027s appeared from the shadows of the trees. His coal black eyes danced malevolently, nose flared as though he could drink in her scent. His lanky dirty blond hair hung unframingly, barely brushing his broad shoulders. He wore a leather bomber over a plain grey tee-shirt with some dark, rugged, and ripped jeans and black construction boots. He smirked a pointed grin, revealing two large fang like teeth as he advanced a few menacing steps. She took a couple involuntary steps back, eyeing the intruder wearily through narrowed eyes. \"Now, what is a beautiful young lady such as yourself doing all on your lonesome in the middle of the woods?\" he asked in knowing concern and mocking wonder. \"None of your business,\" she snapped vehemently. She bristled as he stepped closer, his eyes stalking with the intensity of predator like surveillance. \"Feisty,\" he teased smirking still,\" you need to learn when to bite your tongue.\" She glared with angst sincerely wishing that she could wipe that Goddamn smirk off his scruffed face. \"Maybe you should learn when you are unwanted dumb-ass!\" she retorted, her eyes darted nervously, wishing she had a can of mace with her. Before he could comment, a voice called out, hailing from the direction of the funeral. Cursing, the man raced off, melting into the shadows; the only evidence of his visit, the foot prints imprinted in the snow marking his path. \"Violet!\" the voice called out again, slightly more desperate. One of the casket bearers appeared having gone to search for her. His brown hair flopped over his big brown eyes. \"Hey! We have been looking all over for you... the wake is over, it\u0027s time for the buria- are you okay?\" he asked worriedly, noticing her trembling fingers and wide fearful eyes. She shook her head to clear her mind, \"Yeah I\u0027m fine, just ummm... let\u0027s go.\" She began to walk briskly from clearing in an attempt to put as much distance between her and the man, scrambling her way through the trees and brush, looking back over her shoulder constantly. The bearer struggled to keep pace. \"Why do you keep looking over your shoulder?\" he huffed, tripping as he became entangled in the low but dense brush. Well,\" she confided with a furtive glance in the general direction of the clearing, \"there was some strange man and...\" \"Did he hurt you!\" the man interrupted with incredulity. He grabbed her elbow to keep her from walking and spun her around to look her up and down. \"No, I just... I\u0027m really fine. Let\u0027s just go,\" she tugged away persistently, but he was having none of it. Grasping her elbow in an iron grip, he began to drag her even faster than she had been walking, nearly dragging her to the ground in his haste. He let go of her arm tentatively upon reaching the safety of the cemetery grounds. Together, they weaved their way around the endless mass of graves. Names like Elizabeth and John popped out as she raced past the grey and black stones. Is this the fate of all mankind? - A piece of marble slat with meaningless etched names and dates. A group of people stood solemnly around the newly dug hole, all waiting expectantly. Two grave diggers stood side by side with dirtied faces, leaning heavily on their shovels. All this was according to her grandmother\u0027s wishes. \"\u0027the grave is to be dug by hand; no backhoes or such... bury me with some dignity.\u0027\" Those were the words a clever and amused lawyer read to her, a smile playing at the corner of his thin lips. By the looks of the dirtied grave diggers, they did not find her grandmother\u0027s words amusing. Violet was relieved that the casket was now closed for good; there were to be no more peeks at the decaying body. She did not like the stony expression that was molded on her face in death; it was too similar to the expressions the people in wax museums have, except without the sheen. Her grandmother\u0027s grave resided next to her mother\u0027s. Her mother\u0027s, next to her father\u0027s. There they were almost all of her family (her grandfather\u0027s on the back of the grandmother\u0027s and her father\u0027s crazy sister doesn\u0027t have a grave. She died in a fire, her will burned with her. Her ashes are floating somewhere in the blue green sea). Violet blinked back tears that had sprung into her eyes threatening to cascade. She had not cried through out this whole three day ordeal; not when the body was found, nor when the telephone rang, neither the numerorous explanations or the power hungry lawyers. She didn\u0027t even release a shred of emotion when she learned that she would have to go to the orphanage, the state having deemed she was too immature to live by herself being only 16. Their was a severe sense of finality however in the burial and it made her heart thump and her breathing become rugged. She supposed it was mostly because of seeing her so close with her parents and all the dirt and snow that would eventually blanket her, cutting off all chances of her coming back... well, unless she became a mindless zombie. Her grandmother\u0027s shrewd lawyer, with sharply defined features, grabbed her hand with a comforting squeeze. She watched as the box landed with a thud into her new resting area. The white snow that was left around the hole was dirtied by the mud from the thawing ground and the rocks scooped. Time suspended, one of those strange moments where you worry that the sky is going to break falling in glittering bits and pieces. The priest read from the bible, some line of how we were born from dust and dust we will become again. In a moment, the spell was broken, everything snapping back to reality and time. He stopped and cleared his throat, snapping the small, black, leather bible shut and tucking it inside his coat pocket. Nodding curtly to Violet, he departed the depressing scene hastily. The grave diggers began to throw the pile of dirt back into the hole, shoveling rhythmically so that the clump made a solid beat... coyotes, at least that\u0027s what she assumed them to be, howled mournfully from deep in the woods. Violet sauntered up to the stones that were her family. She read her fathers grave: Ian T. Blacke 1985-1998 \"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.\" ~Emiliano Zappa She turned reluctantly to her mother\u0027s grave that resided close to her father\u0027s: Salia L. Blacke-Canton 1983-1998 \"The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.\" ~Virginia Woolf With a sigh, she turned scrutinize the newest addition to the collection of slabs. She knew these quotes better than the back of her own hand, having come to that very spot to contemplate life, the only place she could achieve a pensive state well enough to write, draw, (which she was rather suckish at) and sing/play guitar (which was what she considered the better of her failures). Etched into the smooth face, she read: Edith Stanton 1942-2011 \"To the well-organized mind; death is but the next great adventure.\" ~Albus Dumbledore Violet smirked, the corners of her usually pouting lips twitching playfully at the corner. \"So,\" the lawyer began, dropping his hand where they swung restlessly and a bit nervously at his side. He returned to formality with a sad reluctant smile. \"Their are business matters to discuss. Firstly, your grandmother sold her house to the bank giving you $20,837.57... that is when you turn 18.\" Violet nodded wiping her moist eyes on the back of her hand leaving a smear of black in it\u0027s wake. Damn, she thought bitterly, that\u0027ll be the eyeliner. \"Secondly,\" he continued, \"she had $2,341.82 saved up in cash to give you the day she was buried.\" He pulled a Manila envelope from his pocket and handed it to her. \"Here ye be,\" he said with a tight, some what forced grin, \"I\u0027ll take you back to the house. The orphanage is picking you up in an hour.\" He looked at his watch. She nodded her understanding with a sniff and followed him to his fancy silver Porsche. She sat down stiffly. He started the car and pulled out of the cemetery. The lawyer said nothing on the short drive back to what used to be her house. The radio was off and the only sound to be heard was the gentle hum of the engine. Once the car rolled to a gentle stop, it\u0027s destination having been reached, the lawyer departed with a simple, \"Good bye.\" Violet exited the car and nodded her head curtly and gave a lazy wave. He sped off allowing himself only one backwards glance. Shuffling her feet up the brick path, she opened the red front door tentatively. Looking around, she recalled where all her old furniture in the now barren and mostly emptied rooms had belonged. That was when reality came crashing down; she would never see this place again. Storming wildly into her bedroom and slamming the door behind her so that the walls shook, she glared menacingly at herself in her full length mirror that hung idly on her closet door. Critically scrutinizing, she narrowed her eyes. Her hair was raven black and had a natural purple sheen when in the sun. It was shaggy and unkempt because of its numerous edgy cut layers giving her the roughness of a rocker; not to mention the hoop looped through her nose, the star labret through her lip for a Monroe piercing, and the over zealously pierced ears. Her eyes, great round orbs of stormy grey against her pale complexion, shone like thunderous dark storm clouds. At the moment, she appeared bleak and lifeless, but she normally had rosy cheeks giving what would be dead features some life. A thin white scar zigzagged its way down her cheek from the corner of her left eye. She never knew where it came from but she enjoyed making up tales whenever people asked. Her small lips naturally settled in a definitive pout or a devilish smirk. It seemed she had no true grin. She was tall and slender, not supermodel scary thin... but thin enough where it seemed none of the normal clothes ever fit her right. She was pretty. Not amazingly drop dead gorgeous like her mother had been,p90x workout schedule, but she possessed enough spunk for people to find her attractive. Her surly attitude and sarcastic humor was what kept most people at bay. For her, this was a helpful attribute... just the way she liked it. She sighed breaking eye contact from the mirror and became even more furious. She ran into the kitchen, searched the nearly empty cupboards, seized the best china that was left, and smashed it against the tile floor. The porcelain shattered spraying shards in every direction. One flew back and hit her on the lip, making it bleed; yet the effect was satisfying. At that precise moment, she had made her decision. She would not let people order what to do and when to do it. She was her own person and could make her own decisions whether they were mistakes or life altering; it would be all her fault, no one else. She raced back into her room, nearly falling headfirst around the corner of the hall, and began a violent frenzy of action. Stripping off her clothes, she changed into her favorite pair of black skinny jeans, a long sleeved black undershirt, and her maroon Panic! At the Disco shirt on top. She double checked to make sure she was wearing her black gemmed poison ring, and her swirly silver thumb ring. She put on her simple black choker, checked that she was still wearing her silver pentacle, and simple black locket. Finding all in check, she grabbed her grey military style messenger bag, stuffing it with a pair of jean shorts, her black Bellatrix Lestrange shirt, and a pair of black and white checkered pajama pants. She shoved the manila envelope into a zipper pocket of the bag to ensure that it would not fall out. Slipping into her clunky, grey, lace up boots with the buckle; she swung her bag on her shoulder and scanned the room at the doorway. \"Oh Reg! Can\u0027t forget you!\" She stumbled over to her big glass tank that stood at the foot of her small dais bed. Lifting up Reggie, her small black pet snake with narrow red eyes and a pointed flitting tongue, he entwined himself through her fingers and up her sleeve only to coil snugly around her neck, falling asleep. She stood underneath the doorway once again, scanning her purple and black striped bedroom for the last time. She checked the cuckoo clock that hung on the wall in the hallway just outside her door. \"Better hurry,\" she muttered to Reg. She quickly stopped into the \u0027library\u0027 of the house. Each wall was lined with shelves where stacks and stacks of books were sorted alphabetically. It pained her to have to leave them all. She scanned the bookshelves hastily. \"Eureka!\" she cried out triumphantly, startling Reggie so that he raised his head in annoyance and gave a little hiss of defiance. Clutching the thick blue paperback book she had been searching for, she leafed through the comforting pages of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix before putting it too into her bag. Reaching into her back pocket, Violet pulled out her small black cellphone that was covered in black skulls and roses. She dialed one of her co-workers at Shorty\u0027s, Nashua\u0027s best Mexican Restaurant. \"Hey Lynn!\" she greeted, \"I was wondering... you still going to Florida? With Jose?\" \"Yeah...\" came her curious response over the phone. \"Do you think I can tag along? And would it be too much to ask if we left in say... 10 minutes?\" she asked double checking with the clock hanging on the wall. \"Gosh! Sure! Jose is here now and the bags are all packed in the trunk; we were just waiting for a good time to leave... Now works!\" she gushed happily over the phone. \"Good,\" Violet said, flooded with relief, \"I will meet you there in about 5-10 minutes.\" \"\u0027Kay! See you then!\" she replied cheerily. Violet ran her fingers through her hair. She grabbed her green military style jacket off the coat rack by the door and put it on, careful not to hurt Reggie who was still asleep on her neck. He wriggled a bit as the coat went on but settled down quickly enough with a few comforting words. She slipped on her turquoise and black, checkered and striped hobo gloves. Hitching up her bag and buttoning her coat, she locked the doors. Turning on her heel, she whipped the only key as far as she could into the neighbors\u0027 bushes. She grinned mischievously at the thought of the social workers trying to get in with her and the key missing. She made her way down the street, refusing to look back even once at what she was leaving behind. Once on the main road however, she had a hard time not glancing backwards. To someone driving by, it almost appeared as though her head were on a swivel. She was nervous that the police or the social workers were going to swoop down at any moment, condemning her to a dreary existence at the orphanage. \"Well,\" she muttered bitterly to Reg, \"if they do, they\u0027re going to have to bloody drag me, damn it!\" After about 5 minutes of suspenseful brisk walking, Violet made it to Shorty\u0027s without any inconvenience. It was quite uneventful besides her jumping at every sound. She pushed open the door and entered the brightly painted restaurant with the southern decorated theme. Lynn jumped up and down excitedly, her bright Irish blue eyes twinkling with the glee seen when someone knows they are being rebellious. \"Jose\u0027 just went to go and bring the station wagon up front. We handed in our aprons already, you going to do the same?\" \"No, the less they know about me leaving the better.\" Violet checked her cellphone. \"About this time now the stupid social workers from the orphanage will be pounding their meaty fists on my front door right now...\" she noted worriedly to herself. Together, Lynn and she exited the restaurant as Jose pulled the old Station wagon up. Violet crawled into the back seat. Half of the seat was taken already by leafy green bags of pot and white powders of cocaine. She shoved them aside in disgust and sat down. \"Hey!\" Jose hollered from the front, twisting frantically in his seat, \"Watch the stash!\" She rolled her eyes as Lynn sat in the front seat, near fit to burst with excitement. \"Okay Jose\u0027, let\u0027s go... quickly,\" Violet ordered eyeing the time apprehensively, they had to know she was gone by now. Jose glared at her through the rear-view mirror but did as she ordered with a sigh of exasperation, understanding the ride would not be an easy one. The car sped off past where she had just come from. As she passed the street that led to her house, she ducked wearily from view. She watched as they passed the church, the condos, and the suburban houses. Her heart thumping wildly, she began to relax once they passed some of the Hollis Farms. That was when she remembered... taking her phone out of her coat pocket, she glanced at it longingly before rolling down her window and chucking it as far as she could into the snow of the annual strawberry patch. She rolled her window back up. When Lynn turned and gave her a quizzical look, she answered her unasked question with a muttered, \"couldn\u0027t have them trailing me.\" \"I\u0027m going to bed,\" Violet announced, \"wake me up when we stop to eat.\" With that generally random announcement, she fell into a deep troubling sleep. Scenes ran through her mind of her being chased by a wolf through a peach grove. When it went behind a bush, it was a wolf, but emerging from behind the shadows, he was suddenly that smirking sinister man... Violet\u0027s nose twitched as the car lurched repeatedly. She awoke with a big stretch and a wide tremulous yawn. Reggie too stirred around her neck. He hissed gently in her ear before coiling up again to sleep in a more comfortable position. She noted the bumper to bumper traffic and the obnoxious honking of horns. The sky darkened and the billboards around the city began to light up with dazzling neon signs and displays. \"New York City?\" she guessed. Jose jumped a little, startled. \"Yeah,\" he answered, \"didn\u0027t know you woke.\" He rubbed his face as if he could scrub off the sleep that threatened to engulf him. His dark hair stuck out at odd angles and his chocolate brown eyes were partially covered by his drooping eyelids. His skin was a deep caramel tan. Lynn stretched and yawned, waking also. \"Where are we?\" she asked, failing to hide a tremendous yawn. \"New York City,\" he grumbled,Scarpe Gucci Italia, moving the car forward a couple inches before having to stop again. Lights flared and horns blared; people swore and kids whined. \"THAT\u0027S IT!\" Jose hollered in frustration. With some difficulty, he pulled the car out of the line of traffic to the side of the road and parked. \"I\u0027m going to eat and sleep. We will leave here at 7. Maybe then the traffic will have lightened up. Go do whatever and meet me here.\" The clock on the dashboard read 6:15. \"\u0027Kay,\" Lynn and Violet agreed simultaneously. They both got out of the car stiff-legged and cramped from being encased in such a small place. The two limped down the crowded street. \"What do you want to do?\" Lynn asked, as they continued to meander down the street. Violet\u0027s stomach growled loudly in demand for it\u0027s fulfillment. Lynn chuckled and tossed her wavy brown hair over her shoulder. \"Come on.\" She led the way entering a little cafe. Waiting in line, they bantered nonchalantly about what they would do once they reached Florida. \"Pffft. It\u0027s simple. I\u0027m going to Disney and Wizarding World!\" Violet said, only just deciding the plan while they talked. Lynn chuckled her cute giggle. \"I\u0027m going to get an apartment and live with Jose. He\u0027s going to lie and say he\u0027s Puerto Rican...Though you know he\u0027s really an illegal alien... and then we\u0027ll live happily ever after.\" Violet rolled her eyes, her lips pursed in a sorry attempt to withhold her ever-present opinion. \"What?\" Lynn demanded, hands on her hips, \"Don\u0027t you believe in happy endings?\" \"No. I don\u0027t,\" Violet answered quietly, \"that\u0027s why I\u0027m going to Disney. I can pretend they do. Truth to the matter is we all end up in a box where people forget who or even where you are and walk all over you. Your bones turn to dust and all that remains, if you\u0027re lucky, is a stone with your name engraved on it. That too will eventually crumble.\" Lynn sobered instantly from this fact. Violet wanted to kick herself for putting a damper on her dreams and innocence. She was one of those few people whose mind wasn\u0027t tainted or desecrated by the filth and lies of the average human. She was pure, despite being on the run with an illegal drug dealing Mexican, which, on its own, was quite remarkable. \"How may I help you?\" the cashier asked. \"Errrrr... I would like your chicken noodle soup.\" Violet turned expectantly, waiting for Lynn to order. \"I\u0027ll have the Caesar salad and lemon meringue,\" she ordered. \"Okay,\" the cashier said ringing up the total,Gucci Stivali, \"that\u0027ll be $9.32.\" Violet dug into her pocket and pulled out a crumpled twenty she had had in there for a while. He handed her the receipt and the meal they ordered. The two found an empty table and sat down. Violet stuffed the change in her pocket along with Reg, who until this moment was curled fast asleep around her neck. \"Sorry Reg...\" she mumbled apologetically when he gave a little hiss of discontent. \"Who are you talking to?\" Lynn asked curiously, spraying crumbs across the small table, having just taken the bite of her meringue. \"Oh errr... Just my little friend here, Reggie,\" she said, pulling him out of her pocket for closer inspection. He flicked his little, red, forked tongue in greeting. Lynn squealed and backed her chair up as far as she could go without hitting the people behind her. \"That is disgusting!\" she exclaimed. She eyed the snake tentatively with trepidation. Reg hissed displaying his little white fangs; puffing up with indignation. Violet returned him back into her pocket with a shrug, she had met many people who possessed these feelings. It was either that reaction or the people coddled him, much to Reg\u0027s dismay. The two conversed, a palpable awkwardness in the air, about the busyness of New York City and the long ride to come. Lynn looked longingly at the little bit of lemon meringue and Caesar salad that was left over. \"I should bring some to Jose,\" she decided wearily. Gazing at the food intently, she stood reluctantly and began to pack up the food onto one plate. \"Here, I\u0027ll come with you,\" Violet offered, \"I\u0027m done with my soup.\" She sauntered over to the trashcan and discarded her empty Styrofoam soup bowl. She followed Lynn out of the cafe as they meandered down the busy sidewalk. \"Hello there,\" a scratchy voice muttered from a dark and dank alleyway. Violet and Lynn twisted around simultaneously to see a small, bone thin woman with ragged, unkempt, loose curls that hung listlessly down her back. Her hair was either a natural dirty blonde or she was simply so dirty that her locks appeared so. Her pale blue eyes were ringed heavily with thick, smudgy, black eyeliner giving her the wild manic look of a rabid raccoon. She leaned against the side of the brick building in her too large mossy green trench coat. She wore ragged and ripped jeans with unlaced hiking boots. \"Listen,\" she began, \"I\u0027m in a bit of a sticky situation. I\u0027m going to be beaten to a pulp if I don\u0027t get money for some necessary... errrr... medicines that I have snatched... The point is I am willing to perform a service...like tattooing or something.\" The troubled druggie shrugged her shoulders suggestively, obviously hoping one of the two dumb-founded girls would agree. \"No, I don\u0027t think so,\" Lynn snapped venomously, disgusted and offended by the offer. She began to stalk off, expecting Violet to follow her lead. Violet stood thoughtfully however in between the pissed off and impatient Lynn and the hopeful yet questionable druggie. \"You can\u0027t seriously be contemplating this!\" Lynn asked in utter disbelief. Violet gave a petulant shrug and looked away deciding it best not to answer. Lynn threw her hands up in exasperation and frustration. \"Whatever!\" she cried out angrily, \"I\u0027m not your mother...do what you like. I\u0027ll be at the car.\" Violet\u0027s face hardened at the maddeningly bossy rant; her eyes narrowed at the receding form of the fuming Lynn. \"\u0027Kay!\" she called over her shoulder as she followed the druggie down the dark dreary alleyway filled with stinking dumpsters and other trash items that people threw, too lazy to try and make it in the trash. She stumbled to a sudden stop when the \u0027tattooist\u0027 came to a halt without warning, pulling out a moldy, tattered, black briefcase that was closed shut with rusted hinges and clasps from behind the putrid green dumpster. \"Here we are,\" she rasped. Violet watched as her bony arms seemed to nearly snap from the heavy lugging of the case. \"So what\u0027s your name?\" Violet asked conversationally, cringing when she got a glimpse of the rusted needles that were being filled with ink. \"Acacia,\" she answered distractedly, concentrating more on the readying of the needles. She had a dangerous manic glint in her wide dilated eyes as she placed the black ink into the designated capsule of the needle. Eyeing this procedure with interest, she noted with utmost amusement that the women had an extra finger on her left hand that dangle limp and useless. \"Okay!\" Acacia cheered with a sadistic dimpled grin, \"what do you want and where?\" \"I... er... want the deathly hallows symbol on my wrist,\" she directed. She sighed at the blank glazed response from Acacia. \"Like this,\" she informed, drawing a triangle with a circle in the middle and a line through all of it on the green and black grime found on the wall they were crouched next to. \"Simple enough...\" Acacia shrugged. Taking the needle she began to pierce the ink into her skin, drawing the symbol. Violet winced, drew a sharp intake of breath, and bit the inside of her cheek from the pain. This process lasted for about 10 minutes before Acacia cheered an exuberant, \"Done!\" She knelt with an outstretched and eager palm. Violet reached into her pocket, moving Reggie to the side, to retrieve the change she had gained at the cafe from her purchase of the delicious meals. \"Thanks!\" Acacia cackled, skipping off to pay the drug-dealers she had stolen from. Violet eyed her new tattoo skeptically. It was puffy and red, definitely irritated from the lack of practical equipment and sterilization. She walked out of the alleyway clutching her pained wrist protectively as it throbbed. So intent was she on getting back to the car that she didn\u0027t notice a young man in his twenty\u0027s come barreling into her, colliding heavily. The man, who had dirty blonde hair and a cocky grin, jumped to his feet uninjured and unharmed. Violet, on the other hand, lay flat on her back. She groaned holding her hand to her head as she slowly sat up. Her hand flew instantly to her side to pet Reggie, making sure he was safe and unharmed. He hissed to prove his health was in order, even if his ego wasn\u0027t. \"I am so sorry!\" the biker apologized profusely, holding out his hand helpfully, \"are you all right!\" She stood up avoiding his outstretched his hand. He eyed her up and down taking inventory of all the injuries: bloody lip, black eye, black and blue chin, and minor abrasions on her arms, hands, and knees. She slumped over to the stone steps of a tattoo parlor and sat down, a bit dazed. Dragging his bike over, he grabbed the little white box with a red cross from underneath his seat in a little zipper compartment. He began to clean some of her cuts with the antiseptic, accidentally brushing her arm lightly with his pinky fingertip. Violet squinted her eyes as if pained as she suddenly was the man. The stupid prick, he thought angrily, God damn; hope she doesn\u0027t sue... She came to a shuddering stop as she was jolted back, seemingly herself. She shook her head,Tory Burch Heels, furious but still slightly dazed. Rummaging through the battered box, the smarmy man pulled out some bandages. He began to stick them on her hands and arms when he noticed her wrist. \"What the hell!\" he said in wide eyed shock. He took a wipe and began to dab gently at the irritated tattoo. \"Is it broken?\" he asked in worried confusion, holding her wrist gingerly, closely examining the puffy red area. He was nervous now about the legal issues that could be troubling him in the close future. \"No... errrrr... I recently got a tattoo.\" Violet lowered her head slightly abashed, quite embarrassed by her compulsive and rebellious decision. It reminded her greatly of the time she had been admonished for letting a friend pierce her nose and lip because of her grandmother\u0027s strict rules on ears only piercings. The man looked up at the brightly lit and extravagantly decorated sign that hung over their heads. \"From here?\" \"Umm, not exactly,\" she replied shiftily, averting her eyes, trying to avoid the discussion, \"It was actually in that alley next to the tattoo place.\" She tilted her head in the direction of where she had gotten the simple tattoo. She scowled as she said it, the confession sounding even more stupid and immature out loud. The man eyed her skeptically with a look that suggested he felt he was superior to her, only she knew that was exactly his opinion. Violet bristled. \"Aren\u0027t you only seventeen-eighteen?\" he asked, his eyebrow arched in question. \"That\u0027s none of your business,\" Violet replied waspishly. Her face became stony as her eyes blazed fiercely and she jutted her chin out stubborn and indignant. This defensive act confirmed the man\u0027s question that she was not old enough to have a tattoo... she may not have been old enough to even be by herself. \"Your point?\" she challenged testily, contempt dripping heavily from every fiber of her being. \"My point! You are ridiculously stupid!\" the man laughed heartily and obnoxiously. He shook jovially from his raucous laughter. \"To each his own,\" she answered coldly, \"besides, it doesn\u0027t affect you in anyway what so ever. So you carry on your damn way to the grave and I will do the same with mine.\" \"By the way,\" she tacked on with a smirk of the devilish kind, \"do everyone a favor, take your damn tight spandex, shove it up your ass, and take some of your pretty boy money that we all know you have and buy some frecan clothes. By the way I believe your fianc??e Anne Smith won\u0027t be happy that you have been spending some nights slutting it up with her sister... Lisa.\" Violet grinned with her victorious burn as he plucked dubiously at his skin tight black spandex and an ugly red slowly creeped up his face, acknowledging what she said was true. She waved her hand dismissing the annoying prick of a biker as he stood dumb struck and sputtering. He stammered, groping for a reasonable retort, \"next time, watch where you are going you whore.\" He peddled off quickly, looking relieved he had managed to get away from the \"secret-spilling, maniacal, whorish witch\". Violet stood holding the antiseptic wipe and continued to gingerly swab her wrist. She stormed back to the station wagon, ready to leave rapidly before anything else ludicrous or stupid occurred. She came to a sudden halt at the scene that unfolded a mere 10 feet before her. Lynn was being handcuffed as tears streamed down her freckled face,true religion jeans günstig, while Jose was chased down by three cops. He was having a hard time running away due to the fact his pants were hanging half way down his ass. Violet chuckled humorlessly to herself, now considerably all alone, she was not fazed. Though people often said her grandmother took care of her, the truth to the matter is she was often away at bingo or some sophisticated society, there for she was never truly around to care. Violet had often made her own way \u0027cooking\u0027 microwave meals and doing laundry, or simply crumpled in a ball; face inches away from a spell binding book. Now, she was down a ride and stranded in a cruelly busy city where no one gives a damn about anyone. To top it off, her money and the bag were in the car that was now being searched for more drugs. Jose was squished into the back of the cruiser next to the hysterically sobbing Lynn. Violet began to panic, she needed some sort of distraction, and now; that is if she was going to escape notice when retrieving her bag. She turned frantically scanning the crowd when she noticed a little whining boy relentlessly tugging on his mother\u0027s pant leg. \"I want a pop!\" he wailed miserably; the mother continued to gawk nosily at the scene that was taking place. Violet hurriedly checked her pockets, making a pissed Reggie hiss menacingly as she groped around him. Pretending to drop something, Violet whispered, \"Hey, hey kid.\" He stopped wailing and glared daggers at her. \"My name. is Zac,\" he growled bitterly. \"Errr...okay. Zac. I need you to do something for me...\" she began conspiringly. \"I ain\u0027t doing nothing for you,\" he interrupted, crossing his little chubby arms. \"Oh you will if you want this pop,\" she threatened, holding a blue raspberry pop tantalizingly out of reach. She always carried some candies and chocolate in her pocket due to her ravenous sugar addiction. Luckily, she had a good lollipop flavor in her pocket, not one of the suckish kinds such as watermelon. The kid eyed the lollipop with wide longing eyes. \"So do we have an understanding?\" She smirked as he nodded with a slightly dazed and awestruck gaze. \"Alright,\" she grinned victoriously, \"you need to run right in front of the car right there and distract them however you can. Do whatever it takes to make sure that police officer doesn\u0027t notice me. I will come to you signaling when the \u0027act\u0027 is over. \" \"Okay,\" the little kid nodded enthusiastically. He ran into the middle of the crowd of onlookers, shoving a few people brusquely out of the way and began to pretend to choke. The cruiser pulled out to bring Lynn and Jose to the station, while the other two cops eyed the small \u0027choking\u0027 child with a panicky uncertainty, neither knew how to perform CPR. \"Can\u0027t breathe!\" the kid sputtered, inhaling deeply with great rattling breaths. Everyone gathered around as the mother shrieked. Violet crept over to the station wagon and opened the back door quietly, everyone\u0027s attention being on the little devious child. She reached her hand searchingly under the front seat from the back where she had stowed the bag for the journey. She grabbed the bag and quickly but silently shut the door. Her mission accomplished, she scurried up to the boy who lay on the cold cement, holding his breath so his face went blue. Violet knelt over his little body and whispered into his ear to get up, thankful that her shaggy hair covered any conspicuous glances or actions. He sat up, a wide grin spread across his face from cheek to cheek, as his hysterical mother attacked him with hugs and kisses a plenty. The little kid was now clutching his blue raspberry lollipop in his small tight fist. \"Oh my poor baby!\" the mother sobbed, \"What were you choking on!\" \"Air momma,\" he answered innocently. The mother blushed an instant beet red as Violet hooted with laughter. The police officers stalked over; furious they had been showed up as fools. They began to reprimand her on her awful parenting skills. Voila! An instant argument was aroused. Violet walked off, a slight bounce in her steps, bag slung across her shoulder, and a small smirk accenting her strange and unusual luck. After a few blocks of walking, her bounce began to fade gradually but surely until she gave up all together and sat with her head in her hands on a nearby bench. She had no idea how she was going to get to Florida now. What to do... What to do? A black mustang came to a creeping stop in front of the bench Violet sat at. She looked up wearily. \"Do you need a ride?\" The driver rolled down the passenger window and peered through. He had blonde hair streaked blue and spiked with gel. He had a hoop through his nose and one through the corner of his lip. \"Err... actually yeah,\" she answered uncertainly. A strange vibe emitted from him, filling her with unease and worry... it was one she could not recognize or truly understand. \"Where you headin\u0027?\" he asked, reaching across the passenger street to open the door for her to enter. \"Well,\" she answered, \"as far south as you would be obliged to take me.\" \"I\u0027m driving to Washington... is that far enough?\" he asked hopefully. \"Yeah, I can hitch another ride from there,\" she nodded thankfully. She seated herself down and tucked her bag beneath her feet. As soon as she was settled in the luxurious seats of his car, he pulled out from the sidewalk to be sandwiched in the midst of the bumper to bumper traffic. \"So,\" the young man began conversationally, \"are you from around here?\" Violet peered sideways carefully. His dark brown eyes were full of question and genuine interest. She wished to avoid this interrogation but was too charmed by his carefree smile that seemed to never leave his face. \"No,\" she answered cautiously, \"I\u0027m from Nashua, New Hampshire.\" \"I see,\" the young man said, with a curious tinkle in his big soft eyes, \"You strayed far... So why did you leave?-wait that\u0027s too personal... forget I asked that.\" \"No,\" she answered, heaving a deep sigh, \"It\u0027s a fair enough question and seeing you are giving me a ride I might as well divulge...\" By the time she finished explaining and reasoning for her escapade, the two were speeding down the highway. She pulled Reggie out of her pocket and analyzed him closely. \"He\u0027s cute,\" he said with a small smile, looking over to see the snake, \"So... your grandmother\u0027s death kind of set all this in motion?...\" \"Well yeah,\" Violet stated as though it was the most obvious thing in the world, \"I wasn\u0027t going to live in that stupid orphanage. Besides, I like to travel, and it\u0027s my life. I have the right to pursue my happiness.\" She rested her head back on the leather seats. The lull of the speeding car was beginning to make her sleepy. She stared bleary eyed and unfocused outside of the window as the scenery seamlessly blended into acre large farms with fields dotted here and there with black and white patched cows. He turned the radio on to fill the silence. Violet perked at the song that filled the car. \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I\u0027m a man of wealth and taste, I\u0027ve been around a long, long year, and stole many a man\u0027s soul and faith...\" \"I love this song,\" she cheered sleepily, \"Sympathy for the Devil; Rolling Stones.\" She nodded her head dreamily to the beat of the tune that sounded from the speakers. \"Pleased to meet you... hope you guess my name, ah, what\u0027s puzzling you is the nature of my game...\" Violet hummed quietly and began to doze off at the comforting and familiar song. Her dream began with the usual swaying palm trees and sanded beaches. The ocean waves lapped peacefully against the seashore. The beautiful and hunky Jack Sparrow sat next to her, simply talking and absent mindlessly twisting her fingers... The dream began to dissolve around her and was filled with shadowed faces. Some leered while others stared open mouthed in fright. Two female faces shown out clearly, but when she woke she would not be able to describe them anyway. All the faces melted, only to reform itself into a figure she would not soon forget; it was the man who haunted her at the funeral and now haunted her in her dreams. His dirty blonde, lanky, shoulder-length hair lay limp and unframing around his smirking sinister face. His deep set black eyes leered with the attentiveness of a treacherous predator. He mouthed one sentence, \"it will be you.\" Violet woke with a start, struggling and gasping for air. She glanced around wildly, being rather disoriented. A hand grabbed her shoulder making her jump, frantic. \"Calm down,\" a voice murmured comfortingly. The man was sitting next to her watching worriedly. The events of the day flitted through her mind as she reminisced, allowing her breathing to regulate into slow even breaths. \"Jeesh, you okay?\" he asked quizzically, eyebrows furrowed. Violet nodded not trusting herself to speak. Her reflection on the car window revealed her hideous condition. She had a sheen of sweat covering her unusually pale and lifeless face. Her grey eyes were wide and dilated with terror as her hair stuck out at odd angles even more so than usual. Her rosy cheeks and plum plump lips had drained of color, making her appear as she thought she would look like when she died. \"I\u0027m sorry... errrr... I had a nightmare.\" she croaked, rubbing her neck in an attempt to get her tense muscles to loosen. \"I\u0027ll say,\" he confirmed,\" you tossed and turned moaning over and over for him to leave you alone?... who\u0027s him?\" \"Oh just some creepy guy who showed up at the funeral...\" Violet leaned back and rubbed her eyes with the palm of her hands. If possible, she was even more tired now than she was before she fell asleep. She blinked her eyes rapidly in a desperate attempt to keep them open. They were parked next to a gas pump at a small gas station just outside of D.C. She reached down into her bag and pulled out a crisp twenty dollar bill. \"Here,\" she ordered, shoving the bill into his hand. He stared at it unwilling and refusing to take the money. She shook her head vigorously, \"take it... you deserve it for putting up with such an unprofessional hitch hiker.\" She smiled a small smirk. He reluctantly stuffed the twenty into his pocket. \"Listen, there is something I need to ask you,\" he began awkwardly,\" See I run this, want of a better word \u0027business\u0027. I wondered if you would want to join?\" Violet raised her eyebrows understanding he was about to put his foot in his mouth and ruin the respect she had for him. \"What the hell are you raving about?\" she asked in frustration, itching to touch his hand so she could find out already, but he was too far from reach for an inconspicuous poke. It would be to awkward to reach across and touch him to get some glean of insight. \"Well ummm... I am most commonly misconstrued as a pimp...\" he sighed, slightly abashed and avoiding eye contact. He became quite interested in his left hand\u0027s nails. \"Are you kidding me!\" Violet laughed hysterically without humor, \"you want me to be a whore?\" Her face was set in a hardened expression of incredulity. \"I\u0027m only suggesting it to protect you from dangerous guys out there that take advantage of pretty girls like you...\" \"No,\" Violet interrupted venomously, \"you are the guy who hands \u0027pretty girls\u0027 like me on a silver platter ensuring the sickos have a knife, fork, spoon, napkins, and a belly full of wine. You will get them anything to ensure their happiness and that your pocket is lined with cash.\" She jabbed her finger accusingly, poking him hard in the chest with each angry syllable. She shook her head furiously and grabbed her bag. She stormed out, slamming the car door for emphasis of her fury. She marched angrily down the highway muttering under her breath. \"I\u0027m not a whore.\" His black car trailed her; the bright luminous lights lit her path better than the clouded moon that hid up in the dark starless sky. He rolled down his window. \"Come on,\" he wheedled, \"at least let me take you the rest of the way into D.C.\" \"No.\" She continued on her way quickening her steps. \"It\u0027s dark out, not a good time for sweet desperate girls...\" \"You would know,\" she retorted, \"now leave me the bloody hell alone!\" \"Fine,\" he said with an angry and frustrated sigh. He raced off into the night, tires squealing, as the dark forms of trees swayed in a chilling breeze, branches reaching out threateningly. Violet inhaled deeply and nervously as she was left in a mostly empty highway that was quite dark. She began her trek slowly with trepidation and chills. Having trudged for about 5 minutes, she came to a sudden halt. A big looming figure of a wolf with dark and shaggy locks stood tall and fiercely, blocking her way. His white teeth were sharp and jagged, glistening in the surrounding darkness; his dark eyes shining, strangely familiar. Violet took a sharp gasp of breath. Headlights fell on the beast revealing black fur and a black nose. He flinched back into the shadowy protection of the trees with a low rumbling growl. \"You need a ride you hooligan?\" a wrinkly old woman squawked sticking her heads out of the window. \"Yeah,\" Violet answered with a tremulous nod. \"Well then get in!\" she barked. Violet turned scanning the surrounding area. She backed up carefully until she bumped into the car. She quickly turned wrenching open the door and jumping in. \"You\u0027re a weirdy,\" the old lady snickered. Her many wrinkles were etched in a permanent sullen frown, her Avon red lips pursed as though they constantly tasted lemon. The rosary beads swayed violently as the old lady sped off, down the highway beginning a constant string of nosy interrogations. \"What the hell are you doing on a highway at night? Why do you wear so much eyeliner?... you look like a raccoon. What\u0027s with the piercings?... it\u0027s disgusting. Why are you traveling? Where are you from? Why do you keep looking nervously over your shoulder?\" \"First of all,\" Violet began, \"none of these questions pertain to you so I don\u0027t see why you should know. I am on the highway at night because some dumb ass left me here at this time. Second, I like black eyeliner, deal. Third, I get piercing because I like the adrenaline rush and rebellion of old hags like you...it\u0027s basically the same reason you go to bingo, it makes you feel bad ass. The rest is personal and none of your business.\" The woman scoffed but otherwise seemed unperturbed by Violet\u0027s long winded rant. Violet sighed and rolled her eyes, lying on her arm where it rested on the window as a sort of pillow. She knew this self-centered egotistical type...they never listened. The woman rattled on about the importance of conformity and its attributes. Violet closed her eyes in a sorry attempt to get some sleep. Her thoughts were to befuddled by large wolfish beasts, pedophilic men at funerals, pimps searching for whores, and the meaningless chatter of the lady beside her. The old lady\u0027s voice continued to grate on her ears for another 15 minutes as she stared dejectedly out the window. They had finally made it to the crowded city of D.C. Lawyers ran about in high stilettos, briefcases swinging wildly into photogenic tourists. Bums lazed about holding out plastic cups as they begged for change despite the terribly late hour of the night... \"Did you hear me!\" the old lady hollered, startling Violet so that she jumped, hitting her elbow painfully on the window. \"What?\" she asked testily, rubbing her now bruised elbow. \"I asked,\" the Old Lady grumbled, \"What do you think Jesus did the day he was resurrected? I think he killed the bastards that tortured him.\" \"Well, I\u0027m not the person to be asking such questions. I am not even sure that I believe what is written in the bible... I gave up on church a while ago.\" \"What?\" the woman shrieked horrified, she slammed on the car brakes causing many cars to honk and drivers curse angrily. She didn\u0027t care. \"OUT!\" she ordered shrilly, \"don\u0027t darken my doorsteps with your blasphemous ideas you devil!\" She shoved Violet bodily out of the car onto the dirty sidewalk. Violet clumsily stood and caught her bag as the mad lady whipped it at her. The old woman shook a fist angrily and sped off down the road much to the backed up traffic\u0027s pleasure. The woman\u0027s bumper sticker read: +JESUS 3 YOU!+ Believe Now or Burn in Hell Violet stood slightly dazed on the sidewalk and blinked, able to rid herself of confusion. The strange one way conversation they had had in the car began to make sense, like dominoes falling into place. She would get picked up by an over religious psycho, all the people possible in picking her up: axe murderers, serial killers, strange business men, anyone; she gets the one who hates those who aren\u0027t of the same narrow-mind as herself. \"I\u0027ll give you blasphemy,\" she threatened under her breath. Turning to a hobo that lounged on a park bench, she asked, \"Which way to the nearest train station?\" \"Why there\u0027s one \u0027bout 5 minutes\u0027 walk from here,\" he said and began explaining the directions. She was sick of the hectic crazy hitch hiking and decided she could risk splurging some of her money. \"Thanks,\" Violet nodded, handing him a crisp $10 bill from her messenger bag. The smelly hobo thanked her profusely and skipped down the street gleefully, certain that it was to fill up on more booze. Once the hobo had left, Violet took poor bedraggled Reggie out of her pocket. He was limp and tired, probably hungry too. She would have to find some place soon that he can go catch a meal. She looked into his dull red eyes and petted his head sorrowfully. She put him on her shoulder where he slithered to his usual resting spot, curled snugly around her neck. Violet meandered her way through the twisted and crowded sidewalks until arriving shortly at the train station. \"May I help you?\" the ticket woman droned in a monotonous tone from behind her Plexiglas booth. Translation: Will you hurry the hell up so I can go on my damn lunch break you imbecilic. \"Yes,\" Violet said waspishly, she did not like to be called stupid...whether out loud or in that person\u0027s head. \"I need a one way ticket to Florida.\" The woman snorted malevolently, \"There is no train for Florida... go to North Carolina and then you can switch trains there to go to Florida.\" The lady snorted her contempt, now being pretty blatant about her feeling of superiority. \"Fine, give me one way ticket to North Carolina then,\" she snapped, frustrated with the lack of helpfulness this woman was being. \"That\u0027ll be $62.50,\" she droned, and popped the bright pink bubblegum. Violet muttered madly about the disregard for others and the blatant robbery going on in the traveling industry. She reluctantly took out the cash and paid the rude ticket seller. The woman dropped the change and ticket bitterly on the counter, for Violet to scramble to pick up. Before Violet walked away she called over her shoulder, \"It must suck to be trapped at a train station where people are constantly traveling, living their dream. Oh the irony.\" She loved the face that she left the amazed and heartbroken ticket seller, understanding that travel was her goal in life. The ticket read that the train would depart in 10 minutes. Violet went and sat on the bench that faced the silvery steel railroad track. Head back and gazing at the plain marble ceiling she contemplated the events that had occurred. It was late; the fluorescent lights illuminated everyone with a nasty alien like glow. Everyone around her was tired, each having had dilemmas and problems of their own. Suddenly, a loud train came rumbling and barreling down the track. It came to a screeching halt with a shudder and a low sigh of steam. Grabbing her bag that lay next to her on the bench, Violet scrambled to the second to last caboose, finding a solitary seat and glaring menacingly at anyone who had the thought or intention of sitting in any of the seats surrounding her. She leaned her head against the cool pane of glass and listened to the quiet murmured chatter of the people that stalked up and down the aisle. \"Here\u0027s a complementary pillow, miss,\" a young helper of the conductor offered. He handed her a flat fluff-less pillow to sleep on. \"Thanks,\" she muttered, crotchety and peeved. He walked away; too happy and awake for her liking. Crumpling her pillow into a lumpy ball she attempted to find a comfy spot. Reggie hissed, disgusted at her tossing. She sighed and rolled her eyes. Violet closed her eyes the entire journey of the rattling train. She didn\u0027t see the light powder of snow that had fallen in D.C. disappear as the train moved on further south. Bleak whites and browns made way to spring greens and bright earthy browns, not those dreary tones of death and decay. The morning sun rose shining its rays on the spunky girl whose snake lay coiled up around her throat having left from her pocket as she half slept to find some mice to eat. He had gotten to scare two old women, giving them angina, and startled a now severely shaken mother and daughter. He hissed his content. The girl on the other hand slept fitfully, a little string of drool making a tiny puddle on the terribly flat complementary pillows. She woke with a stretch and an awful crick in her neck. She sat for a few minutes to get her bearings. She looked at the window at the green stretch of grass that lay before. Violet smiled a small smile. She had at least made it south...in a few more hours\u0027 time she would finally be in Florida. The train hissed to a stop at the final station. \"All personnel must leave the train being the final stop. Take all your things with you for we aren\u0027t liable. Have a good day.\" the intercom ordered in a false, cheery, robotic voice. Everyone exited the train in varying degrees of excitement. People pulled overstuffed luggage cases, every one of them seeming to be red because the owners thought they would be different and be able to spot theirs better. Violet shouldered her bag and left, double checking on her way out that Reggie still snoozed around her neck. She went up to this stations ticket booth where a cheerful old man greeted her. \"Good Morning\" he greeted perkily, a wide smile across his face. \"Mornin\u0027,\" Violet mumbled, she was not a morning person, \"I need a ticket to Florida. The soonest one you\u0027ve got.\" She held back a yawn bringing tears to her eyes. \"Oh, I\u0027m terribly sorry,\" he apologized, his face falling slightly upon hearing the request,\" that train broke down. There won\u0027t be one until two days from now.\" \"Damn it!\u0027 Violet swore, making him frown disapprovingly, not that she could care. She stalked off, now in a pissy mood. She couldn\u0027t afford to say in a hotel for even a night, never mind two days! She stalked out of the train station. It seemed that she was back to hitch hiking. Violet shrugged out of her coat and hung it over her bag so it wouldn\u0027t be in her way. It was warm and the air was slightly thicker with the humidity. It was lovely. Birds sang with their melodious chirps and she was in a smaller town, not a busy city. She was still in a surly mood, though it was hard to be with all the light springy air. Wandering around aimlessly, she finally made it on a southbound highway. She trudged down it knowing she looked like a mess and realizing she really had to pee. She hummed Mona Lisa, by Panic! At the Disco thoughtlessly as she gazed at the scenery around her and the passing cars. Violet twisted suddenly on her heel, she eyed a small olive green Yaris roll to a gentle stop behind her. She eyed the parked car with great trepidation and narrowed eyes, weary of who would be behind that tinted window... 本文???自国视科技（www.gesee.com）"]],"pageTitle":"yina8980 | mgoblog","title":"","url":"http://mgoblog.com/users/yina8980?page\u003d0%2C0%2C1%2C0%2C0%2C6%2C5\u0026quicktabs_1\u003d0","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"FIRST_ROW","tableType":"RELATION","tableNum":0,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438043058631.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002418-00010-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":166426387,"recordOffset":166364092,"tableOrientation":"HORIZONTAL","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{63622\u003d1985-1998, 63988\u003d1983-1998, 49248\u003d\"May the Lord be with you.

during reception of successive encoded programs, the address in the second location becomes equal to that of the pending record in stored the first location, the SRAM 116 is full. If additional programs are decoded when the registers in the SRAM 116 are full, the data for the newly received programs is discarded. The SRAM 116 can store the records of up to 1440 programs in its registers, which corresponds to two full days of 15 second encoded programs. Since the computer 95 normally retrieves the records of the decoded programs from the decoder 97 at least once per day, the problem of the registers of the SRAM 116 becoming full normally does not occur., 44890\u003dReferring now of FIG. 3 of the drawings, there is shown a schematic diagram of the encoder 37. The video signal from the input video tape drive 19 (FIG. 1) is connected to the input of the amplifier 43 through the video input terminal 45. The output of the amplifier 43 is connected to the input of a gain control amplifier 47 and to a sync strip circuit 49. Sync strip circuit 49 detects the presence of the vertical and horizontal sync pulses on the input video and develops outputs coincident in time with the presence of such signals on the input. The circuit 49 also develops other outputs temporally coincident with the location of the color burst and back porch. In the illustrated embodiment the sync strip circuit 49 is implemented by a NS 1881 semiconductor chip available from National Semiconductor Co. The sync strip circuit 49 also develops an output which indicates whether the odd or even field of each frame is present at the input 45. The outputs of the circuit 49 corresponding to the vertical sync, horizontal sync and color burst and back porch are connected to the line detect circuit 51. An output of the line detect circuit 51 is connected to the normally open grounding switch circuit 53 for selectively grounding the output of the amplifier 43 during the color burst and back porch signals.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations The system of the present invention has many advantages over those proposed in the prior art. The fact that it is an in-station system in which the encoding, and preferably both the encoding and decoding is performed locally at the station permits the particular line to be encoded to be selected so as not to interfere with other operations of the station and to avoid problems with stripping. It is possible also to use the system to monitor programs broadcast by a station which programs have been encoded at the originating network or syndicator. The system of the invention can easily distinguish between such sources by, for instance, having different sources encode different lines of the video signal or by the use of appropriate preamble codes for different types of sources. While the illustrated embodiment of the invention has been described in connection with programs recorded on video tape and dubbed onto video tape cartridges, it is apparent that other media could be used for storing the programs both before and after encoding. For instance, a video disk, particularly those with a read/write capability could be used as the program storing medium. As used herein, the references to video tape or video tape cartridges are intended to apply equally to other such media whether now in use or introduced in the future.

Therefore, increasing the transmittance T of the polarizing plate so as to realize a bright display in a liquid crystal display apparatus results in decreasing the degree of polarization P of the polarizing plate. This decreases a contrast ratio in the liquid crystal display apparatus. Thus, the transmittance T and the degree of polarization P of two polarizing plates 28i and 28o used in the projection-type image display apparatus using the transmission-type liquid crystal display panel is determined by the tradeoff of the brightness and the contrast ratio of a display. In general, the display quality remarkably decreases at a contrast ratio of less than 100:1, so that the degree of polarization P is required to be at least about 99%. In most cases, the polarization degrees of the polarizing plates 28i and 28o are at least about 99.9%., 27131\u003dIn the projection-type image display apparatus with the above-mentioned structure, the degree of polarization of the polarization beam splitter 32 with respect to a light beam reflected therefrom or transmitted therethrough largely influences the contrast ratio. However, even if the polarization beam splitter 32 has a degree of polarization of at least about 99% with respect to incident light (e.g., laser light) whose scattering angle is negligible, in an optical system of the projection-type image display apparatus, illumination light generally has a scattering angle of ? several degrees; therefore, the degree of polarization of the polarization beam splitter 32 is lower, compared with those of the polarizing plates 28i and 28o. More specifically, since the transmittance of the P-polarized light component with respect to the polarization beam splitter 32 is about 95%, and that of the S-polarized light component is about 5%, the degree of polarization of the polarization beam splitter 32 is very low, i.e., about 95% in accordance with the above-mentioned Formula (1). As a result, in the projection-type image display apparatus with the above-mentioned structure, the contrast ratio is very low, i.e., 20:1. In order to solve this problem, the following attempt has been made: the polarizing plates 28i and 28o are provided as polarization selecting elements on an illumination unit side and a projection element side of the polarization beam splitter 32, and the degree of polarization of the combination of the polarizing plate 28i and the polarization beam splitter 32 and that of the combination of the polarizing plate 28o and the polarization beam splitter 32 are prescribed to be at least about 99%, whereby a contrast ratio of at least 100:1 is achieved., 57932\u003dFIG. 3A shows the relationship between the transmittance and the wavelength when the polarizing plate β and the output side polarizing plate 28o are disposed in parallel Nicols; FIG. 3B shows the relationship between the transmittance and the wavelength when the polarizing plate β and the output side polarizing plate 28o are disposed in crossed Nicols. In the same way as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the transmittance is normalized with the transmittance of the output side polarizing plate 28o alone being 100%. By comparing FIG. 2A with FIG. 3A, it may be understood that the transmittance under parallel Nicols is improved from about 75% to about 90% by changing the input side polarizing plate 28i from the polarizing plate α to the polarizing plate β, whereby a bright display is obtained. However, comparing FIG. 2B with FIG. 3B, in the case of using the polarizing plate β, the transmittance under crossed Nicols is increased up to about 10%; as a result, even when the transmission-type liquid crystal display panel 7 displays a dark display, light is transmitted. The contrast ratio in the polarizing plate β and the output side polarizing plate 28o is about 9:1. As a result, the contrast ratio in the projection-type image display apparatus using the polarizing plate β and the output side polarizing plate 28o remarkably decreases. In this way, in the conventional projection-type image display apparatus, the brightness and the contrast ratio cannot be simultaneously improved., 68738\u003dIn the projection-type image display apparatus of the present embodiment, the combination of the polarization beam splitter 12 and the retroreflecting sheet polarizer 6 is used, whereby the degree of polarization of the combination can be made at least about 99%, in spite of the fact that each degree of polarization is less than about 99%. As a result, a small-sized projection-type image display apparatus having outstanding brightness and contrast ratio can be obtained. Actually, a projection-type image display apparatus which is about 1.3 times as bright as the conventional projection-type image display apparatus and has a contrast ratio of at least 100:1 can be obtained., 51334\u003dIn one embodiment, the polarization selecting and reflecting element is a circularly polarized light selecting and reflecting element. More specifically, the polarization selecting and reflecting element splits a light beam into a first circularly polarized light and a second circularly polarized light having different rotation directions, reflects the first circularly polarized light, and converts the second circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light and outputs it. The cholesteric polarizer 4 of the polarization selecting and reflecting element has an optically active layer containing a cholesteric (chiral nematic) material, which reflects a polarized light component as a result of interaction with the direction and pitch of a spiral structure of chiral molecules and transmits the remaining component. The transmitted polarized light component (circularly polarized light component in the present embodiment) is converted into linearly polarized light to be output by the quarter-wave plate 5 (this type of cholesteric polarizer is described in Japanese Laid-open Publication No. 6-281814.), 54789\u003dAccording to the present invention, as the polarization selecting and reflecting element, those other than the circularly polarized light selecting and reflecting element can be used. For example, a linearly polarized light selecting and reflecting element (e.g., a retroreflecting sheet polarizer) can be used, which splits a light beam into first linearly polarized light and second linearly polarized light having polarization axes different from each other by 90?, and which reflects the first linearly polarized light and transmits the second linearly polarized light. The retroreflecting sheet polarizer is a sheet-shaped polarization beam splitter in which a microprism array is coated with a dielectric layer (SID, 1992 Digest, p. 427). In the case of using such an element, the number of components and the cost can be reduced, compared with the case where a quarter-wave plate and a cholesteric element are used., 66549\u003dThe polarization beam splitter 12 in a wide band range has a degree of polarization of about 95% and a contrast ratio of about 20:1. However, in the present embodiment, the use of the combination of the polarization beam splitter 12 and the retroreflecting sheet polarizer 6 enables the degree of polarization of the combination to be at least about 99%. As a result, a projection-type image display apparatus with a contrast ratio of about 300:1 can be obtained. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the following advantage is obtained. In the conventional projection-type image display apparatus as shown in FIG. 7, the light beam A2 is absorbed and converted into heat by the polarizing plate 28i provided on the illumination unit side of the polarization beam splitter 32. Therefore, the characteristics of the polarizing plate 28i are degraded, and the display quality is decreased due to the increase in temperature of the liquid crystal layer in the reflection-type liquid crystal display panel 27\u0027. In contrast, in the present embodiment, the light beam A2 is reflected by the retroreflecting sheet polarizer 6. This prevents the decrease in display quality due to the temperature increase and the degradation of the characteristics of the polarizing plate 8i, caused by light absorption., 71219\u003dFurthermore, the transmittance of the polarization selecting and reflecting element or the polarization selecting element tends to increase as the degree of polarization thereof decreases. Therefore, the transmittance T1 of the combination of the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the polarization selecting element satisfies T1 QT with respect to the transmittance T of the polarization selecting element in the conventional projection-type image display apparatus. Thus, according to the present invention, an image display apparatus having a bright image with outstanding use efficiency of light and excellent display quality can be obtained. In the case where the illumination unit has a concave mirror, since a light beam reflected by the polarization selecting and reflecting element is reflected by the concave mirror and incident upon the polarization selecting and reflecting element, the light beam generated by the alteration of a plane of polarization during this process is incident upon the liquid crystal display panel and contributes to the display. More specifically, for example, even if each degree of polarization of the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the first polarization selecting element is less than about 99%, as long as the degree of polarization of the combination thereof is at least about 99%, a bright projection-type image display apparatus with a contrast ratio of at least 100:1 can be realized., 55998\u003dAs described above, with the polarizing plate used for the input side polarizing plate 28i of the transmission-type liquid crystal display panel 27 in the conventional projection-type image display apparatus as shown in FIG. 6, the transmittance T and the degree of polarization P are determined in light of the contrast ratio of a display. This polarizing plate (hereinafter, referred to as a \"polarizing plate α\") has characteristics, for example, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. FIG. 2A shows the relationship between the transmittance (%) (vertical axis) and the wavelength (nm) (horizontal axis) when the polarizing plate α and the output side polarizing plate 28o are disposed in parallel Nicols; FIG. 2B shows the relationship between the transmittance and the wavelength when the polarizing plate α and the output side polarizing plate 28o are disposed in crossed Nicols. The transmittance is normalized with the transmittance of the output side polarizing plate 28o alone being 100%. As is apparent from FIGS. 2A and 2B, the transmittance T is sufficiently low under crossed Nicols in a visible wavelength range. The contrast ratio in the polarizing plate α and the output side polarizing plate 28o (ratio between the transmittance under parallel Nicols in FIG. 2A and the transmittance under crossed Nicols in FIG. 2B) is about 1400:1, and the contrast ratio in the projection-type image display apparatus using the polarizing plate α and the output side polarizing plate 28o is about 300:1., 59508\u003dIn contrast, in the present embodiment (e.g., the projection-type liquid crystal display apparatus in FIG. 1), the brightness and the contrast ratio can be simultaneously improved. Hereinafter, such a projection-type image display apparatus will be described in detail. In the present embodiment, the combination of the polarizing plate β and the polarization selecting and reflecting element (including the cholesteric polarizer 4 and the quarter-wave plate 5) is used. FIG. 4A shows the relationship between the transmittance and the wavelength when the combination of the polarizing plate β and the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the output side polarizing plate 8o (which is identical to the polarizing plate 28o) are disposed in parallel Nicols; FIG. 4B shows the relationship between the transmittance and the wavelength when the combination of the polarizing plate β and the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the output side polarizing plate 8o are disposed in crossed Nicols. As is apparent from FIG. 4A, in the present embodiment, the transmittance under parallel Nicols is about 85% which is higher than that shown in FIG. 2A, and the transmittance under crossed Nicols is as low as that in FIG. 2B. In the present embodiment, the contrast ratio in the combination of the polarizing plate β and the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the output side polarizing plate 8o is about 1500:1. Thus, the projection-type image display apparatus of the present embodiment has an outstanding contrast ratio and brightness, compared with the conventional projection-type image display apparatus., 72726\u003dAlternatively, according to the present invention, in the projection-type image display apparatus including the reflection-type liquid crystal display panel, the polarization selecting and reflecting element is provided on the illumination unit side of the polarization beam splitter, and the degree of polarization of the combination of the polarization beam splitter and the polarization selecting and reflecting element is at least about 99%. That is, in place of the polarization selecting element used in a conventional projection-type image display apparatus, the polarization selecting and reflecting element is used. As a result, the polarized light component which is absorbed and converted into heat by the polarization selecting element in the conventional projection-type image display apparatus is reflected by the polarization selecting and reflecting element. This prevents the decrease in display quality due to the temperature increase and the degradation of the characteristics of the polarizing plate, caused by light absorption, whereby reliability can be improved. Furthermore, the degree of polarization of the reflectiontype liquid crystal display panel with respect to linearly polarized light incident thereupon is determined by the combination of the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the polarization beam splitter. Therefore, even if the degree of polarization of the polarization selecting and reflecting element or the polarization beam splitter is less than the degree of polarization of the polarization selecting element in the conventional projection-type image display apparatus, the contrast ratio of the display can be maintained or improved by prescribing the degree of polarization of the combination to be at least a predetermined value. In the case where the illumination unit has a concave mirror, since a light beam reflected by the polarization selecting and reflecting element is reflected by the concave mirror and incident upon the polarization selecting and reflecting element, the light beam generated by the alteration of a plane of polarization is incident upon the liquid crystal display panel and contributes to the display. More specifically, for example, even if each degree of polarization of the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the polarization beam splitter is less than about 99%, as long as the degree of polarization of the combination thereof is at least about 99%, a bright projection-type image display apparatus with a contrast ratio of at least 100:1 can be realized. Furthermore, the polarization selecting element is further provided between the polarization selecting and reflecting element and the polarization beam splitter, whereby the degree of polarization of the combination thereof is kept at a predetermined value or more to further improve a contrast ratio.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.

Now where have I seen this plot twist before? Hmmm, let me think... AH! it was SUZUKA! Honoka stopped dating the male protagonist whose name I can\u0027t remember because he was always doing things with suzuka, and thinking about her. Now, I don\u0027t say I don\u0027t like Seo Kouji as a mangaka, but I do think that he should stop doing the same thing over and over again. I could just read Suzuka again if I wanted to read that. Opinions, please?","Post #269689","i don\u0027t care. yeah, he could have done some other twist, but i\u0027m kinda happy that it\u0027s finally done. can\u0027t stand slow pacing stories. god damn, he could\u0027ve friggin prolonged it by 3 volumes or so TRY TO SEE THE GREATER PICTURE OF POSSIBILITIES AND YOULL BE HAPPY","Post #270010","Personally, I think that it is too early to compare this to other manga. Nanami may have said that she can\u0027t date him now, but that doesn\u0027t mean that he will date Yuzuki for the rest of the story (well, unless the story turns into Pastel). In my opinion Haruto treats Yuzuki just like his sister and that is why he can\u0027t leave her alone. If he can tell that to Nanami, then he still has a chance right now. I mean, there are only three guys in the story who live in town (and one of them is Nanami\u0027s brother), so it\u0027s not like she is going to start dating some other guy right now. Just give the story some time.","Post #271131","Exactly - the only simularity that i see in this to Suzuka is the artist. The main charactors are completely different - one being a loser who can run when he tries and the other being a smart kid that just happens to be not very good at expressing his emotions. Contrary to him not doing anything, he has already confessed and chased after what he wanted, even though it did not work out as he wanted - i think as long as there is no unwanted pregnacy in this one i will be happy lol","Post #271137 - Reply to (#271131) by SirLoki","Quote from SirLoki i think as long as there is no unwanted pregnacy in this one i will be happy lol I have to second this Lets see if it will be similar to Suzuka. 41 chapters have only been released, thats nothing. Give it a chance first But yeah, of course there are gonna be similarities within the stories, especially if it\u0027s worked before in his previous works. You know how the saying goes, why fix it if it \u0027aint broke? ________________","Post #271143 - Reply to (#271131) by SirLoki","Quote from SirLoki Exactly - the only simularity that i see in this to Suzuka is the artist.

Well, i haven\u0027t read it and have no intention of doing that now.The boy got dumped by the one he had a crush on and got his face squeezed into another girl\u0027s chest later 0_0 i don\u0027t think it\u0027s a twist, so predictable. However, with the same depth of the plot, more ECCHI would make this manga greater \u003e_\u003e ________________","Post #273684","Don\u0027t defile this manga with thoughts of ecchi -_-. I think the manga is really good especially with the references from Suzuka. Of course your going to see similarities but that is more cause that is the mangaka\u0027s own way of doing things. It has several things that are its own and the main characters being different from each other is one such example. I can\u0027t wait to see more of this manga since its really good. Its just too bad I\u0027m gonna be on ship for about 28 chapters of it in about a month and a half XD. ________________ If it makes sense, your probably wrong.","Post #274395","Forgive my rudeness, it\u0027s just that i don\u0027t think \"ecchi\" is something that would defile an \"ecchi manga\" (but still it should be used properly \u003d_\u003d) and personally i think this manga would be more intriguing with more stimulating factor.Anyhow,i have to admit that it\u0027s very good the way it is now, like a beautiful love story with a peaceful rhythm. ________________","Post #284398","This isnt completely a boob grabbing and panty shot ecchi manga. At least it has a plot and story to it. Also IMHO that \"unwanted pregnancy\" in Suzuka wasnt bad at all.

Haruto is a much better character. He knows what he wants and can handle things pretty well. I also prefer Yuzuki over Suzuka. She isn\u0027t an arrogant b**ch. Don\u0027t compare Kimi no Iru machi with Suzuka! Nanami is stupid for dumping Haruto. He and Yuzuki have a brother-sister relationship and it\u0027s not like Haruto is always thinking about Yuzuki and has a crush on her (like the guy in Suzuka). btw..did you notice that Suzuka and KNIM are connected. The stories run parallel.

The dubbers may have mistaken this character for an unrelated anime character. The same thing happened to Vincent. When Vincent appeared in the Silver Conference (known then as Jackson in the dub), Marina and Jimmy were referred to \"Dani and Yoshi\" respectively, leading many to believe that \"Yoshi\" was the official English name for Jimmy, and \"Dani\" was the official English name for Marina. Whether this was the original intention remains unknown. However, in The Legend of Thunder!, they\u0027re identified as Jimmy and Marina. Much like Ash is based on Red, Jimmy is based on Ethan.

For example, the plug and jack could each be part of cylindrical housings, one of which nests in the other. In such a case the resilient sealing member that seals the gap between the two cylindrical housings could be, for example, a rubber O-ring encircling the inner cylindrical housing and retained on a groove thereon. The diameter of the O-ring could be slightly larger than the inner diameter of the outer cylindrical housing so that the O-ring is maintained in compression when the inner cylindrical housing is inserted into the outer cylindrical housing. One example of a telephone interface connector in accordance with this invention, as shown in the drawing, comprises a plug 1 part of which fits into a jack 2 contained within a jack housing 3. There are four metal contacts 4 on plug 1 which make electrical contact with four corresponding metal contacts 5 in jack 2. The spacing between adjacent metal contacts is very small, typically only about 20 mils, which makes an unprotected connector especially susceptible to environmental degradation. There is a surface 6 on housing 3 which mates with, but is slightly separated from, a corresponding mating surface 7 on plug 1, when plug 1 is inserted into jack 2.

A TCP connection source address is classified in a good address state when an ACK packet or a RST packet is received from the untrusted network with the source address. The source address is reclassified from the good address state to a new address state after a first predetermined time period passes without receiving the ACK packet or the RST packet from the untrusted network. Furthermore, the source address is reclassified from the new address state to a bad address state after a second predetermined time period passes without receiving the","textAfterTable":"US20040123142 * Dec 18, 2002 Jun 24, 2004 Dubal Scott P.

Atari 2600 versions When Pac-Man was released for the Atari 2600, over a million units were sold.But because of Hardware limitations, it did not look like the arcade one. The ghost were the same color, you had to eat square blocks instead of dots, and the whole image just didn\u0027t stand up. Although this helped gained Atari some bucks, it tarnished its reputation, which would follow them for years to come. Due to copyright issues, ébivision never released their Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man for public sale. A copy, with label and box, was given away to Jeff Rothkopf for being the first person to find the hidden level in Alfred Challenge.

She will use a stronger team here―but will not appear until her Pokégear phone number has been obtained from the Olivine City diner. She goes there every afternoon, between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, but will travel to Kanto for battles on Wednesday afternoons. After defeating her in a rematch, Jasmine will call the player on his or her Pokégear to suggest a trade. She offers a Steelix nicknamed Rusty (Japanese: ??`ル Neil) (OT: 26491) that holds a Soothe Bell. She will accept any Pokémon in exchange.

Erika is apparently trying to convince Jasmine to go participate in Pokémon Super Contests in Sinnoh, indicating that the events of HeartGold and SoulSilver versions most likely happened prior to the events of Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. Jasmine is the only in-game trade in the series that doesn\u0027t require the player to have a specific Pokémon to give. The moveset of Jasmine\u0027s team in Generation IV is almost completely identical to the moveset in Generation II - the only difference is her Steelix knows Sandstorm instead of Sunny Day. Jasmine appears as an opponent in Pokémon Puzzle Challenge. She uses a Steelix to battle. When rematched in HeartGold and SoulSilver, Jasmine\u0027s levels are actually the highest of all of the Johto leaders, despite her typically being the sixth leader; her Steelix reaches level 62, while the maximum of any other Johto leader is level 60. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Jasmine uses an Empoleon in her team in a rematch against the player.

For all of the embodiments, a counterweight 34 may be provided on the baffle or conveyor hub opposite the shelf. The center of gravity of the counterweight is contemplated to be opposite that of the shelf, and essentially at the same radius, so that the conveyor will remain balanced in both wet and dry operation. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the shelf 60 has a peripheral edge 63 which is substantially parallel to the inside wall of the frusto-conical portion 33 of the bowl. Alternatively, the shelf may be arranged parallel to the axis 17 or at any angle which will form a restriction for the heavy phase. Also, the peripheral edge of the shelf may extend between adjacent portions of the conveyor flight in a direction other than axially along the centrifuge. In the above embodiments, reference has been made to a radial type baffle, in the form of a disc, cone or the like.

The block diagrams of FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate the sensor is electrically connected to a source of well regulated constant current or constant voltage. By measuring changes in the voltage or current respectively the changes in magnetic permeability arising from strain of the magnetostrictive components under load can be measured and continuously monitored in real time. In FIGS. 10A and 10B the sensor of FIGS. 9A and 9B is further modified by parallel apertures 826 surrounded by load carrying sleeves 825 in the E-cores 822 and 824. The apertures 826 permit eyebolt devices similar to FIG. 6 to apply precompression and permit tensile forces and compressive forces 832 to be conveniently measured. Coils 830 are wrapped about all three sleeves 825 and apertures 826 and connected electrically in series. Illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B is a substantially planar form of the sensor. E-cores 722 and 724 symmetric about a center plane 743 comprise a center piece 720 and side pieces 740 above and below the center plane. Wrapped about the center piece 720 is the coil 730. The E-cores may be constructed of ferromagnetic material, permanent magnet material for dynamic force measurements or magnetostrictive film material on a non-magnetic substrate.","textAfterTable":"US8707793 * Nov 24, 2009 Apr 29, 2014 Robert Bosch Gmbh Sensor system having a magnetoelastic deformation element US20040211268 * Apr 25, 2003 Oct 28, 2004 Morelli Donald T.

the size of the valve annulus has been determined, the appropriate replacement valve is then identified. A variety of replacement valves may be used in the method of the invention, including many of the more widely-accepted valves used in conventional open-chest aortic valve replacement procedures. These include mechanical valves such as the St. Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.), the Carbomedics Prosthetic Heart Valve (Carbomedics, Inc., Austin, Tex.), and the Sorin Monostrut Heart Valve or Sorin Bicarbon Valve (Sorin Biomedical, Inc., Irvine, Calif.), as well as bioprosthetic or tissue valves, such as the Carpentier-Edwards Pericardial Bioprosthesis or Carpentier-Edwards Model 2625 Porcine Bioprosthesis (Baxter, Inc., Edwards CVS Division, Irvine, Calif.)., or Medtronic Hancock MO Bioprosthesis or Medtronic Hall valve (Medtronic, Anaheim, Calif.). In addition, the method of the invention may be used to replace a diseased aortic valve with an autologous graft such as the pulmonary valve from the same patient, which may be removed thoracoscopically from the patient\u0027s pulmonary artery using thoracoscopic instruments and visualization devices positioned through access ports between the ribs. Allografts, such as an aortic valve removed from another donor patient\u0027s heart, may also be implanted using the methods of the invention. While the aortic valve replacement procedure of the invention will be described with reference to a mechanical bileaflet valve such as the St. Jude Medical Mechanical Valve, it should be understood that the methods described are equally applicable to other types of mechanical valves, as well as to bioprosthetic valves, autografts and allografts., 45558\u003dThis application is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/485,600, filed Jun. 7, 1995, now abandoned which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/281,962, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/163,241, filed Dec. 6, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,215, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/023,778, filed Feb. 22, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,452,733. This application is also a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/486,941, filed Jun. 6, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,661. The complete disclosure of each of the above-referenced applications is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 102697\u003dClamp applier 140 has, as shown in FIG. 7, an actuator 164 at its proximal end which comprises one or more movable leaves 166 pivotably mounted to a shaft 168. Leaves 166 are linked to clamp applier jaws 162 by a linkage 170, best seen in FIG. 8, which may be a rod or wire slidably disposed in a lumen 171 within shaft 168, linked to a scissors mechanism 172 coupled to jaws 162. In this way, moving leaves 166 toward shaft 168 causes jaws 162 to move between an open position for releasing clamp 136 to a closed position for grasping and closing clamp 136. Clamp 136 is preferably biased into an open configuration by a torsion spring (not shown) around pin 152 or a compression spring (not shown) between proximal extremities 154, 156 of jaws 142, 144. In this way, once locking mechanism 148 is released by deflecting fingers 150 away from each other, clamp 136 will be urged open as clamp applier jaws 162 are opened. Other aspects and alternative configurations of clamp 136 and clamp applier 140 are disclosed in commonly-assigned copending application Ser. No. 08/567,966, filed Dec. 4, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,618,307, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 85494\u003dIn a particularly preferred embodiment, arterial return cannula 26 includes an additional hemostatic port (not shown) at its proximal end that allows endoaortic catheter 32 to be slidably positioned through the blood return lumen of the arterial return cannula. Arterial return cannulae having such a configuration are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/282,192, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,584,563, which is incorporated herein by reference., 144901\u003dFIGS. 27-29 illustrate an additional embodiment of an access port for retraction of tissue within an intercostal space so as to provide an open passageway through which a replacement valve may be positioned into the chest. Access port 350 comprises a tubular body 352 having an axial passage 354 configured to allow a replacement valve to be positioned through it without contacting the inner walls of the axial passage. Tubular body 352 is a metal or biocompatible polymer with sufficient rigidity to retract intercostal tissue and to retain a shape suitable for positioning a replacement valve through the axial passage into the chest. Axial passage 354 preferably has a cross-sectional shape suitable for introducing a replacement valve or sizing disk through it in the edge-first orientation illustrated in FIG. 25, such as oval, elliptical, racetrack, rectangular, trapezoidal, or other suitable shape. Axial passage 354 will have a cross-sectional width orthogonal to a central axis AX of less than about 30 mm, usually about 10 mm-25 mm, and preferably about 15 mm-20 mm. The cross-sectional length of axial passage 354 orthogonal to central axis AX will be larger than the outer diameter of the replacement valve utilized, and usually substantially larger than the cross-sectional width of the axial passage, usually being about 15 mm-50 mm, and preferably being about 25 mm-40 mm. Tubular body 352 has an exterior shape and dimensions suitable for positioning access port 350 in an intercostal space without cutting or removing the ribs, and preferably without significant retraction of the ribs from their natural, undeflected positions (e.g. less than about 10 mm of retraction). In an exemplary configuration, the outer surface of tubular body 352 has a shape corresponding to that of axial passage 354 with a wall thickness therebetween of about 0.25-2 mm, preferably 0.75-1.25 mm. Of course, the exact size and shape of tubular body 352 will be determined by the size and shape of the replacement valve to be utilized in the procedure., 133677\u003dReferring now to FIG. 22, knots 300 are formed in each of sutures 264 outside of the chest, and a thoracoscopic knot pusher 302 is used to push knots 300 along sutures 264 through lumen 212 of access port 192, through aortotomy 184 and against sewing ring 286 of prosthetic valve 288. Knot pusher 302 preferably has an elongated shaft 303 to which is attached a head 304 with a convex curvature on its distal end 306 and a pair of axial channels 308, 310 along its lateral sides, as described in copending application Ser. No. 08/288,674, filed Aug. 10, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,576, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. One end of each suture is threaded through channel 308, a knot 300 is formed in the suture distally of head 304, and the other end of the suture is positioned in channel 310. While holding the ends of suture 264 in tension, knot pusher 302 is advanced toward prosthetic valve 288, engaging knot 300 with distal end 306 and sliding the knot along suture 264 until it is against sewing ring 286. Several knots are formed in each suture in this manner. The ends of sutures 264, along with needles 266, are then trimmed off above knots 300, using thoracoscopic angled scissors 194 or other suitable cutting device., 137566\u003dIn an alternative technique of keeping air out of the heart during the procedure, the chest cavity may be flooded with a gas such as carbon dioxide at the outset of the procedure to prevent any air from entering the chest through the access ports. A gas delivery tube may be introduced through an intercostal access port, or a gas delivery lumen may be provided in a wall of the one of the access ports themselves through which the gas is delivered. To facilitate maintaining the gas within the chest, the access ports may be provided with gaseous seals such as those commonly used in laparoscopic trocar sleeves which provide a gas-tight seal both when an instrument is introduced through the port, as well as when the instrument is removed. These and other techniques for removing air from the heart and aorta are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/585,871, filed Jan. 12, 1996, attorney docket No. 14635-23-6, entitled \"Methods and Apparatus for Preventing Air Embolism When Performing A Procedure On A Patient\u0027s Cardiovascular System,\" which is incorporated herein by reference., 81144\u003dThe patient is first prepared for aortic valve surgery by putting the patient under general anesthesia, establishing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and inducing cardioplegic arrest. General anesthesia is induced in a conventional manner. A preferred technique for accomplishing CPB and cardioplegic arrest which does not require a sternotomy, thoracotomy, or other opening in the patient\u0027s chest is illustrated in FIG. 1. Additional aspects of the systems and methods for inducing cardioplegic arrest described here may be found in patent application Ser. No. 08/282,192, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,584,803, and Ser. No. 08/486,216, filed Jun. 7, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,151, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 87860\u003dIn addition to delivery of cardioplegic fluid in the \"antegrade\" manner via endoaortic catheter 32 as just described, it is usually desirable to deliver cardioplegic fluid in a \"retrograde\" manner through the coronary sinus during the aortic valve replacement procedure. For this purpose, a coronary sinus catheter 52 is placed into a peripheral vein 54, preferably the internal jugular vein or subclavian vein in the neck, and advanced through the superior vena cava into the right atrium, where it is maneuvered into the coronary sinus (not illustrated). Coronary sinus catheter 52 has a balloon or other expandable member 58 near its distal end 60 which may be expanded by means of a syringe 62 to occlude the coronary sinus during fluid delivery. A delivery lumen (not pictured) extends through the coronary sinus catheter 52 to a port at its distal end 60 to allow delivery of a cardioplegic fluid, which will usually be similar to that described above used in antegrade delivery. Coronary sinus catheter 52 may also include a pressure port near distal end 60 and a pressure lumen extending to its proximal end for monitoring pressure distal to expandable member 58. Other aspects of coronary sinus catheters and retrograde cardioplegia techniques useful in connection with the present invention are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/372,741, filed Jan. 12, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,644, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 89936\u003dIn an alternative technique for inducing cardioplegic arrest, devices are introduced thoracoscopically through access ports between the ribs to occlude the ascending aorta and, optionally, to deliver cardioplegic fluid into the ascending aorta upstream of the occluded area. In these thoracoscopic techniques, the pericardium is first opened to expose the ascending aorta. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, several access ports 71, such as trocar sleeves or other tubular cannulae, are placed in intercostal spaces I between ribs R. A thoracoscope 73 of conventional construction and having a video camera 75 mounted to its proximal end may be placed through one of access ports 71 for visualizing the procedure, or the surgeon may look directly into the chest through one of access ports 71. Thoracoscopic scissors 77 and graspers 79 are introduced through access ports 71 and used to create an incision 81 approximately 4-10 cm in length in the anterior side of the pericardium 83 overlying the aorta 85 so that the ascending aorta 87 and upper anterior side of the heart 89 are exposed. Thoracoscopic scissors 77 and graspers 79 may have any of various well-known constructions, including those described in copending application Ser. No. 08/194,946, filed Feb. 14, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,698, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various alternatives, substitutions, modifications and improvements are possible without departing from the scope hereof, which is defined by the following claims. The access ports of FIGS. 37-42 may also include any of the features of the access ports described above in connection with FIGS. 27-29, including having a suture organizer mounted to the proximal end of the access port for retaining sutures in an organized manner around lumen 498, or having a selectively deployable retention device mounted near the distal end of the access port for engaging the inner wall of the chest (or other body cavity) to maintain the access port in position. Optical fiber 504 may be mounted to access port 490 in various ways. In addition to the annular arrangement of FIGS. 37-40, optical fibers 504\u0027 may also be mounted along one side of lumen 498\u0027, in a crescent-shaped channel 516 extending through cannula 492\u0027, as shown in FIG. 41. Multiple channels (not shown) may extend along two or more sides of lumen 498 among which optical fibers 504 may be distributed. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 42A-42B, instead of mounting optical fibers to the access port, an open axial channel 518 may extend through cannula 492\" through which an endoscopic light wand or thoracoscope (not shown) having a light source mounted to it may be slidably inserted into","textAfterTable":"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Degenerative vavlular disease specific annuloplasty ring sets US8777991 23 Jul 2012 15 Jul 2014 David Zarbatany Mitral valve repair system and method for use US8790398 20 Dec 2013 29 Jul 2014 Colibri Heart Valve Llc Percutaneously implantable replacement heart valve device and method of making same US8808367 7 Sep 2007 19 Aug 2014 Sorin Group Italia S.R.L.

shown above, the present invention provides an operational support system for use in information networks providing transport of data including broadband video and signaling data. Although the disclosed operational support system is disclosed with respect to a video system using hybrid-fiber coax, one having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the disclosed operational support system is also applicable to other networks using other local access technologies, as shown in the above-identified co-pending application Ser. No. 08/413,812, filed Mar. 28, 1995, entitled \"LEVEL 1 GATEWAY FOR VIDEO DIAL TONE NETWORKS\" (Atty Docket No. 680-093A), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. In addition, the above-described operational support system is applicable to other transport technologies, such as wireless systems, as shown in co-pending application Ser. No. 08/405,558, filed Mar. 16, 1995, entitled \"SIMULTANEOUS OVERLAPPING BROADCASTING OF DIGITAL PROGRAMS\" (Atty Docket No. 680-130), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference., 221476\u003dThe communications from the Level 1 Gateway 108 to the main portion of the DET carry a variety of information. For example, these communications include downloading of necessary connection block descriptors to the DET to permit reception of broadcast channels and dynamically assigned channels carrying IMTV downstream transmissions from the VIP. The Level 1 Gateway 108 may also download applications programming and/or operations system software into the main portion of the DET 218. The above incorporated copending application Ser. No. 08/380,755, filed Jan. 31, 1995 (attorney docket No. 680-083C) provides a more detailed description of the software download capabilities of the DET. If certain services require the DET to recognize some form of network address, the Level 1 Gateway 108 would also transmit that address to the main portion of the DET for storage., 139060\u003dAccording to the preferred embodiment, the digital encoder 118 outputs a digitally encoded data stream in DS-3 format (45 Mbits/s), and the ATM edge multiplexer 120 outputs an ATM stream in OC-3c format (155.5 Mbits/s), to a SONET multiplexer 122. The SONET multiplexer 122 multiplexes the DS-3 and OC-3 signals from the digital encoder 118 and the ATM edge multiplexer 120 and outputs the consolidated broadcast data onto the unidirectional optical fiber broadcast ring 102 operating at an OC-48 format (2488.3 Mbits/s). In other words, the SONET multiplexer 122 may receive a plurality of OC-3 optical fibers 121, either from the ATM edge multiplexer 120 or a plurality of such multiplexers. In addition, the SONET multiplexer 121 may receive a plurality of DS-3 signals from a corresponding plurality of encoders such as digital encoder 118. The SONET multiplexer 122 buffers the OC-3 and DS-3 input signals and multiplexes the input signals together at a rate of 2488.3 Mbits/sec. An exemplary SONET multiplexer is the FT-2000, manufactured by AT\u0026T., 184505\u003dA more detailed description of the structure of the DET and NIM and the operations thereof involved in downloading applications software and operating system changes into the DET are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/380,755, filed Jan. 31, 1995 (attorney docket No. 680-083C), incorporated herein in its entirety by reference., 91968\u003dAn example of a simple access subnetwork is found in the network embodiment shown in FIG. 4 of commonly assigned, copending patent application Ser. No. 08/304,174 filed Sep. 12, 1994, the loop distribution interface and associated hybrid-fiber-coax distribution system constituted an access subnetwork. A control element there identified as a video manager served as the access subnetwork controller. The backbone network included the ATM switch, and the backbone subnetwork controller was the permanent virtual circuit (PVC) controller. Other types of access subnetworks, backbone subnetworks and subnetwork controllers may be used to construct the video dial tone network interfaced to the OSS in accord with the present invention. For example, fiber-to-the-home or fiber-to-the-curb architectures may be used with the OSS of the present invention. Exemplary fiber-to-the-curb architectures are disclosed in commonly-assigned, copending applications Ser. No. 08/380,744, filed Jan. 31, 1995 (Attorney Docket No. 680-109), and Ser. No. 08/380,758, filed Jan. 31, 1995 (Attorney Docket No. 680-123), the disclosures both of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference., 137941\u003dThe ATM edge processor 120 processes all incoming DS-3 bit streams received thereby, and maps the DS-3 bit streams into at least one condensed, or combined bit stream for transmission through the network. Specifically, the incoming DS-3 and OC-3c streams are supplied to corresponding first-in-first-out (FIFO) input buffers internal to the 120 to supply the ATM cells to an internal multiplexer on a cell-by-cell basis. The internal multiplexer outputs the translated cells preferably to OC-3 output buffers for synchronous transmission on optical fibers 121. Since the ATM cells are output at a rate of 155 Mhz (OC-3), each of the optical fibers 121 carry up to twenty (20) MPEG programs at 6 Mbits/sec. Thus, the ATM edge processor is able to fully load the downstream optical fibers 121 thereby to fully load the capacity of the network. A more detailed description of the ATM cell multiplexer 120 is found in copending and commonly-assigned application Ser. No. 08/380,744, filed Jan. 31, 1995 (attorney docket No. 680-109), the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference., 266370\u003dThus, as shown above, the OSS is primarily responsible for overall service creation, service activation, and service control of network services generally. The Level 1 Gateway, however, is primarily responsible for on-line services between the VIPs and the video information users. As such, the OSS generally will preprovision bandwidth for IMTV purposes. A more detailed description of the control functionality associated with IMTV services is found in commonly-assigned copending application Ser. No. 08/413,812, filed Mar. 28, 1995, entitled \"LEVEL 1 GATEWAY FOR VIDEO DIAL TONE NETWORKS\" (Atty Docket No. 680-093A), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. In addition, detailed descriptions regarding the control and operations of the access subnetwork controller is found in commonly-assigned copending application Ser. No. 08/413,810, filed Mar. 28, 1995, entitled \"ACCESS SUBNETWORK CONTROLLER FOR VIDEO DIAL TONE NETWORKS\" (Atty Docket No. 680-093B), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Finally, while the OSS of the present invention is primarily directed to \"semi dynamic\" allocation of network resources for IMTV purposes, the routing of broadband data throughout the network is described in more detail with respect to the ATM packet demultiplexers in the VNH and the local video access node in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/413,207, filed Mar. 28, 1995, entitled \"ATM PACKET DEMULTIPLEXER FOR USE IN A FULL SERVICE NETWORK HAVING DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE\" (Atty Docket No. 680-116), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Finally, one having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed embodiment is not limited to service creation and service activation, but is also applicable to service assurance and network maintenance operations, such as trouble identification, trouble notification, trouble verification, trouble location, trouble repair, and service verification.

Internet technology originally evolved in the early 1960\u0027s, at the instigation of the US Department of Defense (DOD), to enable strategic computer networks to remain operational in the event of one or more nodes being out of commission during a nuclear war. The logic was simple; bombing a system based on an individual mainframe computer network would result in only a few nodes being lost, while still allowing the other fully functional nodes to route around the damaged ones. This was achieved by using a methodology known as “packet switching??, which worked by breaking up a data file into small “packets?? and transmitting them to another location by multiple routes where the packets would be re-assembled back into the original data file, with the duplicate data packets discarded. In 1969, the first packet-switching network was developed by the Pentagon\u0027s Defense Advanced Research Project\u0027s Agency (DARPA). It was called the ARPAnet, and the original network connected 4 research establishments; UCLA, Stamford Research Institute, UCSB, and the University of Utah. The ARPAnet was an experiment to try to establish “internetted?? or “inter-networked?? communications between several distinct computers or nodes to comprise a network. The term “internetted communications?? or “inter-networked communications?? became eventually shortened to just “Internet??. The initial connections were operating at a “Snails pace?? compared with today\u0027s high-speed fiberoptic lines. To give an idea of the speed involved, the first connections were only operating at 2.4 k bits per second, and soon after increased to 56 k bits per second. Slow by today\u0027s standards, but fast for the time. It was later upgraded as technology improved on an incremental basis. By 1972 the network had expanded to incorporate 40 nodes. ARPAnet soon became a forum for the exchange of information and ideas among scientists and academics, and within a few years the number of computers connected to the network increased to more than 100. By the mid-1970\u0027s, many US government agency networks were linked by ARPAnet and, because the networks were of a disparate nature, a common network protocol called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) was developed and became the standard for inter-networking military computers. By 1983, the word “Internet?? became the common term for referring to the worldwide network of military, research and academic computers. Some key people of note for the development of the ARPAnet\u0027s success are worth mentioning. Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT graduate student, who in 1961 published a paper entitled “Information Flow in Large Communication Nets??. This paper was the first work dealing with the concept of a “Packet Switching?? methodology. The RAND Institute and the National Physics Laboratory in England did independent work in the concept of “Packet Switching?? methodologies in 1964. Lawrence Roberts (a collogue of Leonard Kleinrock) published an overall plan for the development of the ARPAnet in 1966. In 1968, DARPA awarded four contracts to make up the ARPAnet; UCLA, Stamford Research Institute, University of California Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. The end of 1969 connected the four host computers connected together into the initial ARPAnet, and the budding Internet was off the-ground. One by one computers at UCLA (hooked up by September), the Stanford Research Institute (hooked up in October), the University of California Santa Barbara (hooked up in November) and finally the University of Utah (hooked up in December) were brought online. On October 29th, Charley Kline at UCLA sent the first packets. Charley tried to remotely log into the Stanford Research Institute\u0027s (SRI) computers from UCLA. This initial attempt resulted in the system crashing as the letter “G?? of the word “LOGIN?? was entered. Additional computers (nodes) were connected as time passed; one such mapping is outlined in FIG. 3. The map shows several connections linking computers throughout the continental United States. Slowly the bugs were worked out of the system and more and more computers were connected to the ARPAnet. In 1971, an engineer named Ray Tomlinson working at BBN Technologies in Cambridge Massachusetts, saw a limitation in the fact that the ARPAnet could only send files back and forth and had no provision for sending simple text messages. He modified some existing code, and came up with electronic mail, or more commonly, e-mail as we call it today. There were protocols for sending messages through networked computers at that time, but not for sending them through the ever-expanding ARPAnet. He is credited for creating the first Internet e-mail. The e-mail application that he wrote became the most widely used application of the ARPAnet for over a decade. Thanks to Ray Tomlinson, we can find out on a daily basis that we can lose weight fast, get a low interest mortgage, find a mate, get low cost prescription medications, and even enlarge the size of ones penis (if so equipped!). Like everything else in life, a good idea or concept will eventually get misused. SPAM used to only refer to a somewhat “meatlike?? substance that a family consumed at mealtime―not a barrage of superfluous advertisements sent as e-mail.}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{120701\u003dIt should also be stated that a method of collecting payment of priority data service could be enacted as a COD (Cash On Delivery) basis. When the sender requests a priority e-mail or priority data file be sent as a COD, then it will first be encrypted as a “one time pad?? cipher. The one-time pad is the most secure, and one of the simplest, of all ciphers. It was invented and patented just after World War I by Gilbert Vernam (of AT\u0026T) and Joseph Mauborgne (USA, later chief of the Signal Corps). The fundamental features of this cipher are that the sender and receiver each have a copy of an encryption key, which is as long as the message to be encrypted, and each key is used for only one message and then discarded. For complete security, the key must be random, that is without pattern, and must remain unknown to any attacker or unauthorized individual. In addition, the key must never be reused, otherwise the cipher becomes trivially breakable. For example, two identical pads of paper with random letters can be exchanged between sender and receiver, later, when they wish to send a message, the sender uses the (random) key in the pad (say that on the first page of his pad) to encrypt a message. One technique is to exclusive OR, XOR (i.e., combine in a particular way) the first character of the key with the first character of the plaintext, the second character of the key with the second character of the plaintext, etc. Even a simple letter-substitution cipher as has been known at least since Julius Caesar\u0027s time can be used―as long as the offset for each letter is determined individually by the corresponding random letter of the key (the traditional “Caesar cipher?? used a single offset for the whole message). He then sends the encoded message to the receiver, who decrypts it with his copy of the first page of the pad. Both now discard the used key page, having used it only ‘one-time’. One-time pads are information-theoretically secure, in that if all the conditions are met properly (i.e., the keys are chosen randomly, are at least as long as the message, and are never reused), then the ciphertext gives the attacking cryptanalyst no information about the message other than its length. This is a very strong notion of security, and implies that one-time pads are secure even against cryptanalysts with infinite computational power. The problem as pointed out with OTP\u0027s is that the sender and receiver need a copy of the OTP. For security purposes, this is a nightmare, but for the disclosed invention, it is a benefit. It provides a means of delivering a priority e-mail or priority data to the intended recipients PC or computer, but will prevent that information from being viewed until the COD recipient pays a nominal fee to “unlock?? or decrypt the information. When the sender sends priority data as a COD, then the priority service provider will automatically generate a random OTP for that particular document or file. The random OTP will be stored on the priority service providers database to be sent at a later time when the COD recipient submits payment to the priority service provider. When payment is received (electronically, in the form of a credit or debit card, or some comparable form of electronic credit), then the priority service provider will then send its copy of the OTP to the recipient who can then use it to “unlock?? or decrypt the file. One-time pads have been used in specialized circumstances, since the early 1900s; the Weimar Republic Diplomatic Service began using the algorithm about 1920. Poor Soviet cryptography (broken by the British, with messages made public in two instances in the 1920s), forced them to improve their systems, and they seem to have gone to one-time pads for some uses around 1930. KGB spies also used pencil and paper one-time pads to communicate. Beginning in the late 1940s, the U.S. and British intelligence agencies were able to break some of the one-time pad traffic to Moscow during W.W.II as a result of errors made near the end of 1941 in generating/distributing the key material. This huge, decades long effort was code named VENONA. The “hot line?? from the White House to the Kremlin during the Cold War reportedly used a OTP; this line was used so infrequently that pad exhaustion was a minor concern relative to providing the necessary security. The information-theoretic security of one-time pads is wholly dependent upon the randomness (or unpredictability) and secrecy of the key pad material. If the key material is perfectly random (and never becomes known to an attacker), then it is information-theoretically secure. If the OTP material is generated by a deterministic program, then it is not, and cannot be, a one-time pad; it is a stream cipher. A stream cipher takes a short key, and uses it to generate a long pseudorandom stream, which is combined with the message using a mechanism similar to that used in a one-time pad. Stream ciphers can be secure in practice, but cannot be absolutely secure in the same provable sense. At least one of the Fish ciphers used by the German military in W.W.II turned out to be an insecure stream cipher, not a practical automated one-time pad as seems to have been intended by its designers. Bletchley Park broke Lorenz machine messages regularly. None of these stream ciphers have the absolute, information-theoretical security of a one-time pad, although there exist stream ciphers that appear to be unbreakable in practice by a cryptanalyst without access to the key. The similarity between stream ciphers and one-time pads often leads cryptographic novices to invent (usually very insecure) stream ciphers under the mistaken impression that they are using one-time pads. An especially insecure approach is to use any of the random number generators that come with most computer programming languages and operating system call libraries. These typically produce sequences that pass simple statistical tests but that are nonetheless highly predictable―making them absolutely useless for cryptographic purposes. Though Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators exist that permit computationally secure stream ciphers, even these do not provide the information-theoretic security of a one-time pad, and a claim that a particular stream cipher is equivalent in strength to a one-time pad is often viewed as a clear sign of snake oil by professional cryptographers. Shannon\u0027s work can be interpreted as showing that any information-theoretically secure cipher will be effectively equivalent to the one-time pad algorithm. If so, one-time pads offer the best possible security of any cipher, now or ever. Since we are only trying to prevent a person from retrieving priority COD data before paying for that service, the OTP could very well be a simpler stream cipher. Depending on computer processing time, and the computers ability to generate random numbers, it should be a simple matter to generate OTP\u0027s that are reasonably sized. Other economic factors could determine that ordinary RSA encryption or PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption will be good enough. After all, we are not dealing with National Security issues, we are only trying to ensure that the priority service provider gets paid the money that they are due. An OTP is a quick and secure method of sending COD priority data, and should not be that much of a problem with today\u0027s bigger and faster computers. As technology improves, the stuff we are doing today, will be laughed at in just a few years (as far as processing speed, memory size, overall computational power, etc.), as is normally the case! While the preferred embodiment of this patent applies to priority e-mail and priority data, it is not limited to said functionality. It is becoming more and more apparent that the Internet, and subsequently the World Wide Web, will become more and more utilized for applications that it was not originally designed for. Now a day, there is much discussion about using the Internet, and the WWW to provide phone service in addition to video conferencing. The described invention will be able to prioritize ANY data packets for routing throughout the Internet priority sub-network, which would include, e-mail, data files, voice traffic, video data, and any conceivable document conversion data. As the Internet and subsequently, the WWW get more and more tasked, it will naturally lead to unexpected delays in data traffic. An extreme amount of congestion could be realized in the not so distant future, the described invention will enable its customers a guaranteed priority routing through the Internet priority sub-network, while regular Internet data traffic will be subject to the first come, first served standard Internet router/server handling. In the event that some part of the Internet goes down, then with the described methodology of using an auditing process to form a “mapping?? of portions the Internet, alternate “non-priority?? routes could be used. This would guarantee that the priority data traveling through the standard Internet would have a higher probability of reaching its destination than normal Internet traffic. With the ability of utilizing a unique data byte in the data packet sent through TCP and IP protocols, different types of data would be treated differently. If only the priority bits were utilized (in the IP case), then the described invention would not be able to guarantee priority operation., 15183\u003dProvisional Application No. 60/529436 was filed on 12 Dec. 2003, 22069\u003dIt should be discussed that there exists a common point of confusion regarding the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet. Most people think that they are the same thing, when in fact they are not. The Internet is comprised of many independent routers and servers connected by high-speed links of wire or fiber optic cable, in addition to many Internet Service Providers (ISP\u0027s) that are in turn connected to many more users (you and I). The World Wide Web (WWW) is actually a point and click, graphical user interface that allows the user to more easily look at information on the Internet. It is a hypertext language and was created in 1990 by a scientist at the European High-Energy Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN), by the name of Tim Berners-Lee. He developed the concept of the World Wide Web (“WWW??, “W3?? or simply “the web??) as we know it today. The web provides access via the Internet to media-rich documents known as web pages, which may contain formatted text, images and multimedia each web page has a unique address known as a Uniform Resource Locator or “URL??, which allows a page to link to any other page on the Internet via hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are “clickable?? text or images, sometimes known as “hotspots??, embedded in the page itself. A URL is made up of the access method, the name of the server, the directory where the page is stored, and the file name of the page. The URL [http://www.microsoft.com/download/index.htm] refers to the file [index.htm] in the directory [download] on the web server [www.microsoft.com] using the [http] (HyperText Transport Protocol) access method. Web pages are stored on an Internet computer known as a web server and access to the server\u0027s pages is provided by a web browser―a web navigation tool with a user-friendly interface. A single page or a group of related pages are said to occupy a web site, which has a home page or starting point of reference. Web pages are constructed using a common language known as HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language), and access to the web for the general public is supplied by Internet Service Providers or ISPs, who charge monthly or yearly subscriptions for this service. The first web browser, known as Mosaic, was developed in 1993 at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) in the university of Illinois. The use of Mosaic spread rapidly through the academic community and within a year, more than 2 million users were browsing the web. Today however, the most popular web browsers are Microsoft\u0027s Internet Explorer and Netscape\u0027s Navigator. Tim Berners-Lee\u0027s initial hypertext language was HTML, and enabled the development of graphical Web pages. This made it easier to look at information located on the Internet because it was presented in a more visually oriented graphical form. It is kind like comparing Windows to DOS. In the “old days?? of computing, there was DOS (Disk Operating System), and this was a cumbersome, unforgiving, command-line oriented approach to performing operations on the computer. Windows on the other hand, was a graphical user interface (GUI) that allowed the user to simply “point and click?? with a mouse to do the same tasks. In addition the HTML, Tim Berners-Lee also created HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which enabled the user to “point and click?? on a highlighted word or image of a web page to activate it. This could facilitate downloading a file, opening another web page, playing a music or video file, or bringing up another series of menus or information that are not stored physically on that particular website, but are “linked?? through to another computer or node somewhere in the world via the Internet. The user does not have to type in the [http://www.Some_Web_Server_Somewhere.com/Some_Directory/Some_File.ht m] address, they just click on it with the mouse. We could have an Internet without the World Wide Web, but we could not have the World Wide Web without the Internet. A person could have a Windows operating system CD, but without a computer to run it on, it will do no good. The World Wide Web (or as it is affectionately know to some―World Wide Wait―due to increased internet traffic flow) without the Internet is like having an operating system CD without a computer. It is important to understand that the World Wide Web is NOT the Internet, just a GUI for the Internet.}","textBeforeTable":"Referenced by 60 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the software running on the IP router would record the billing information to be used later to generate a bill recording the amount of priority traffic routed through this particular Internet router. 50 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the software running on the IP router would retransmit the stored or buffered data packet with special priority status, and would be placed ahead of regular non-priority status data packets. 40 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the software running on the IP router would retransmit the stored or buffered data packet with regular (Non-Priority) status. 30 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the software running on the IP router would make a decision as to how to handle the routing of the data packet. 20 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the software running on the IP router would parse each individual byte contained in the incoming data packet to determine which byte contains the priority status information bits. 10 Flowchart block diagram section showing how the incoming data packet would be into memory. : FIG. 9 Detail showing bit structure of single 8-bit byte of the IP datagram showing the TOS (Type Of Service) byte","textAfterTable":"* Cited by examiner Classifications U.S. Classification 370/400, 370/395.21, 370/229 International Classification H04L12/58, H04L12/56 Cooperative Classification H04L47/19, H04L47/10, H04L47/2433, H04L51/26, H04L47/2408, H04L51/24, H04L47/2475 European Classification H04L47/24H, H04L47/24C1, H04L47/10, H04L47/24A, H04L47/19, H04L12/58 Rotate Original Image","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":3,"headerRowIndex":0}

accordance with the illustrative embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1, proxy server 135 includes processor 140, web proxy 145, file transport protocol (“FTP??) proxy 150 and mail proxy 160. As will be appreciated, these illustrative proxies enable the proxy server, working in conjunction with the firewall, to provide security features for WWW/Internet access, file transfers and electronic mail, respectively. For example, web proxy 145 is used when a user desires to access particular “web pages?? on the WWW from private network 130. Illustratively, a user employing user terminal 165-3 may access certain web pages on the WWW using web browser 166. Web browsers are well-known software application programs (e.g., Netscape? v. 5.0, available from Netscape Communications) which enable a user to traverse the WWW and access the vast amount of information available throughout the WWW. Thus, web browser 166 receives an input request from the user of user terminal 165-3 and attempts to locate the information on the WWW by establishing a connection with the appropriate resource, e.g., network resource 105, on the WWW through public network 100. The connection between user terminal 165-3 and network resource 105 is established using proxy server 135, web proxy 145 and firewall 180. More particularly, web proxy 145, acting on behalf of web browser 166, will attempt to establish a conventional Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP??) connection between user terminal 165-3 and network resource 105. As is well-known, TCP/IP is the protocol which is used in describing the way in which information is transferred across the Internet. Essentially, TCP/IP separates information into individual packets and routes these packets between the sending computer, e.g., server, and the receiving computer, e.g., client. TCP/IP and Internet communications are discussed in more detail, e.g., by D. Comer., Internetworking with TCP/IP, Third edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1995. In the present embodiment, the TCP/IP connection between user terminal 165-3 and network resource 105 is made across communication channels 190 and 195, respectively, which establish connection between public network 100, private network 130 and, ultimately, user terminal 165-3., 26496\u003dComputer network security, at a minimum, is directed to ensuring the reliable operation of computing and networking resources, and protecting information within the network from unauthorized disclosure or access. Various security threats exist which pose increasingly difficult challenges to such network security. In particular, some of the most sophisticated types of security threats are posed by programs which exploit certain vulnerabilities within network computing systems. To name a few, these program-related security threats include well-known logic bombs, trapdoors, trojan horses, viruses and worms, as described, e.g., by W. Stallings, Network and Internetwork Security Principles and Practice, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1995. Such well-known software program threats either work independently (e.g., worms) to achieve their desired security breach, or require the invocation of a host program to be invoked to perform the desired disruptive actions (e.g., trapdoors, logic bombs, trojan horses or viruses.) Indeed, there are numerous well publicized accounts of such programs being used to improperly breach the security of private computer networks and cause severe damage (see, e.g., J. Hruska, Computer Viruses and Anti-Virus Warfare, Second edition, Ellis Horwood Limited, New York, 1992.) Such damage has included the destruction of electronic files, alteration of databases, or the disabling of the computer network itself or computer hardware connected to the affected network., 42233\u003dAs seen from FIG. 1, all communications traffic between public network 100 and private network 130 necessarily passes through firewall 180. In recognition of this communications traffic attribute, I have realized that the firewall 180 provides a preferred location for implementing the security advantages of my invention. Illustratively, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, firewall 180 illustratively includes processor 181, database 182, and virus prober 185 which randomly inserts probes within incoming files from, e.g., public network 100, to, e.g., private network 130. In accordance with the invention, the probes inserted by the virus prober 185 are individual programs which will trigger particular actions upon execution. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the probe is a virus probe configured as a trojan horse which, if executed, on a client will launch a signal back to the firewall indicating that the client is misconfigured. Typically, from a computer virus perspective, a trojan horse is a secret, undocumented entry point placed into a useful application program by an unauthorized user, e.g., computer hacker. In the normal course of execution of the useful application program by a user the trojan horse is also executed thereby launching the undesired actions. Trojan horses are described in more detail in Stallings, supra. at pp. 238-241. For example, a trojan horse can be created to gain access to the files of another user on a shared computer system, wherein the unauthorized user creates a trojan horse program that, when executed, changes the authorized user\u0027s file permissions so that their files become readable by any user. This embodiment of the invention utilizes particular features of the trojan horse for delivery of various security advantages to computer networks as discussed in more detail below., 49417\u003dAdvantageously, the invention provides a technique for determining whether particular clients with a computer network are universally configured in accordance with the desired network security features of the computer network. For example, one conventional security measure dictated by most network administrators is a policy that all users within a network, e.g., private network 130, disable certain features of their web browser software, e.g. Netscape?, and in particular the Javascript interpreter feature of the web browser. Javascript is described in more detail, e.g., by D. Flanagan, Javascript The Definitive Guide, Second edition, O\u0027Reilly \u0026 Associates, Sebastopol, Calif., 1997. Briefly, Javascript is a well-known interpreted programing language useful, e,g., in developing programs which relate to and involve web browsers and HTML. For example, when a web browser includes a Javascript interpreter, the browser enables executable content, e.g., programs, to be distributed over the Internet (and WWW) in the form of Javascript “scripts??. When the script is loaded into a Javascript-enabled browser the script is executable and will produce particular output as defined by the Javascript instructions of the script. Thus, Javascript allows for the control over the web browser, and also the content of that which appears in a web page, e.g., HTML forms. As will be appreciated, these features which are enabled through the use of Javascript present serious network security risks., 52494\u003dAs discussed previously, the invention provides a technique for determining whether particular clients with a computer network are universally configured in accordance with the desired network security features of the computer network. More particularly, firewall 180 is configured, as described above, in accordance with the invention to insert probes into the incoming communications traffic stream to private network 130. FIG. 3 shows an illustrative incoming communications traffic stream 300 and the insertion of an illustrative probe in accordance with the principles of the invention. In particular, communications traffic stream 300 includes a series of individual packets 300-1 through 300-n, e.g., TCP/IP packets, carrying data from public network 100 to private network 130. Thus, in accordance with the invention, firewall 180 monitors communication traffic stream 300 and randomly inserts probes into incoming files within particular ones of the packets. For example, packet 300-4 contains incoming file 305, illustratively a file having a series of HTML instructions 310. In accordance with the invention, virus prober 185 inserts probe 315, illustratively, at the end of HTML instructions 310. In accordance with various embodiments of the invention, probe 315 is inserted upon a first Internet access from a particular IP address (i.e., client) or browser type, and thereafter virus probes are inserted at random intervals. Illustratively, probe 315 is a virus probe in trojan horse form, as previously discussed, wherein the insertion of probe 315 into file 305 results in edited file 325. Thereafter, edited file 325 proceeds in the transmission of communications traffic stream 300 to private network 130., 54420\u003dIllustratively, probe 315 is a single Javascript instruction 320. As shown, Javascript instruction 320 is of the form “\u003cSCRIPT\u003ex\u003dnew image( ); x.src\u003d‘image1’;\u003c/SCRIPT\u003e which, as discussed above, is an interpreted scripting language statement for controlling a web browser. Further, illustratively, “image1?? is a unique string of characters for identifying probe 315. Basically, probe 315 is a trojan horse which directs the web browser to allocate an off-screen bitmap space, i.e., “new image( )?? and download a small image, i.e., “image1??. In accordance with various embodiments of the invention, the probes can either be stored in database 182 for access by virus prober 185 or stored locally within virus prober 185 itself In accordance with a further embodiment, probes can be downloaded by network administrators from a central source, e.g., the Internet, and added to the existing probe library. In accordance with the invention, if web browser 166 is in compliance with the illustrative network security feature which requires that all web browsers have their Javascript interpreter disabled, probe 315 will not execute and firewall 180 will not generate any security alert. However, in accordance with the invention if web browser 166 is misconfigured, probe 315 will execute causing web browser 166 to initiate a request for the image file, i.e., image1. As described previously, the mere request by web browser 166, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, for a network resource is captured by firewall 180 thereby serving as the signal of a security alert. There is no reason for a properly configured web browser to ask for such a network resource, i.e., image1, unless it is improperly configured and outside of established network security measures. That is, execution of probe 315 means that web browser 166 is Javascript enabled which is not in compliance with the desired security measure of the private network 130 and therefore poses a security risk to the network., 36487\u003dFIG. 1 shows an exemplary system embodying the principles of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the system includes public network 100, e.g., the Internet, and network resources 105, 110, 115, 120 and 125. Illustratively, network resources 105 through 125 can be linked together using files written in the well-known Hypertext Mark-up Language (“HTML??) thereby representing the well-known WWW. The WWW and HTML are described in more detail, e.g., by B. White, HTML and the Art of Authoring for the World Wide Web, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, Mass; 1996. Illustratively, private network 130 is a network located within a particular user site, e.g., a corporation\u0027s headquarters building, having user terminals 165-1, 165-2, 165-3 and 165-4 linked together via LAN 170. As will be appreciated, user terminals 165-1 through 165-4 can be stand-alone personal computers or network terminals. For simplicity of explanation herein, only one such LAN configuration is shown in FIG. 1, however, as will be appreciated private network 130 may include several such LAN configurations similar in nature to LAN 170. A particular user of any one of user terminals 165-1 through 165-4 may cause a client program executing on, e.g., user terminal 165-3, to request certain resources which are available on the WWW, e.g., network resources 105-125. As mentioned previously, such requests to the WWW via the Internet from private network 130 pose certain security risks to both private network 130 and user terminals 165-1 through 165-4. Thus, as shown in FIG. 1, private network 130 includes firewall 180 and proxy server 135 which are configured to delivery certain security features, in accordance with the invention, to protect private network 130 and its various computing resources., 44211\u003dIn accordance with the invention, the virus probe inserted by virus prober 185 at firewall 180 is benign in that the probe is designed to provide a signal back to firewall 180 if executed, rather than perform some destructive action as in the conventional trojan horse sense as described previously. The security features of the invention are preferably implemented and realized at the firewall, e.g., firewall 180, because in networks where firewalls are employed all communications traffic must pass through the firewall. Thus, the firewall is an ideal location for inserting probes in accordance with the invention. However, will be appreciated, the principles of the invention are also realized in other network environments and configurations. For example, in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, the insertion of probes can be accomplished using a particular proxy server within a network that is known to have a high rate of common access and is trusted. For example, a trusted server within a private network which mainly provides an online telephone directory is also an excellent candidate for implementing the principles of the invention due to the fact that this server will be utilized by a high number of user within the private network. Thus, the security features delivered by the present invention are realized in a variety of network, hardware and software configurations including, but not limited to, the system configuration of FIG. 1., 34315\u003dIn preferred embodiments of the invention, the probe is configured as a virus probe in the form of a trojan horse which, if executed, on a client will launch a signal back to the firewall indicating that the client is misconfigured. In further embodiments of the invention, the signal back to the firewall is a User Datagram Protocol (“UDP??) packet. In accordance, with a further embodiment of the invention, the virus probe is inserted upon a first Internet access from a particular IP address or browser type, and thereafter virus probes are inserted at random intervals.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations The foregoing merely illustrates the principles of the present invention. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details shown and described herein. Those skilled in the art will be able to devise numerous arrangements which, although not explicitly shown or described herein, embody those principles and are within their spirit and scope. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the above illustrative C program segment, after being compiled into machine code, is inserted as probe 315 into file 315 and will generate the desired UDP packet upon probe execution. That is, if probe 315 is executed on a particular user terminal, a UDP packet will be launched to firewall 180 as the signal indicating that the user terminal is a potential security risk. close(s); write(s,0x88,1); connect(s,\u0026sin,sizeof(sin)); int s\u003dsocket(PF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,0); struct sockaddr_in sin\u003d{0,9,{0xF14E8All},0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}; As described previously, a further embodiment of the invention employs a UDP packet as the signal back to the firewall when a security alert has occurred. In such an embodiment, file 305 is, illustratively, a file containing certain executable instructions. As is well-known, files having the extension “.exe?? are binary executable files. Thus, in accordance with the invention, probe 315 will be inserted into file 305 at an appropriate location where it is known to be safe for overwriting a small number of bytes of file 305 for insertion of probe 315.

Although the system has been described as having only two PIMs (and thus only two PIM interfaces, only two PIM downloadables, etc.), one skilled in the art will recognize that any number of PIMs may be managed by the system and methods of the present invention. Although the workspace data has been defined mostly in terms of email, calendar, bookmarks, etc, one skilled in the art will recognize that workspace data may include other types of data such as files, financial transactions, etc. Although the PIM Downloadable has been described as including a PIM interface to communicate with a PIM to obtain data to be synchronized, one skilled in the art will recognize that, if the Downloadable knows the location of the data, no PIM interface is needed. Thus, the downloadable may use an engine for retrieving the data from the known location without the assistance of a PIM.

120B, die bonding material 20 is applied to die flag 13. Die bonding material 20 is conveniently a solder paste or solder preform. Solder paste having a composition of 88:10:2 (Pb:Sn:Ag) is suitable for use with silicon semiconductor die, but other well known die bonding materials may also be used. Solder paste in the amount of about 0.5 to 3.0 milligrams is dispensed onto die flag 13 gives satisfactory results for die bonding material 20, but larger or smaller amounts may also be used. The same solder paste and similar amounts is used for bonding material 56 and 58, taking into account the relative sizes of the different bonding areas.}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations In addition, those of skill in the art will appreciate based on the description herein that many modifications and variations may be made in the invention which utilize the teachings and elements presented herein. Accordingly, it is intended to include all such modifications, variations and equivalents in the claims that follow. Further, the vertical motion of the connection clip permitted by the invented arrangement improves manufacturing tolerance. Further, the self-centering action between the die pad and the connecting lead improves the surge capabilities of the device. Ordinarily, the lead to be connected to the bonding pad on the die must be made smaller than the bonding pad to insure that it does not, through misalignment for example, touch the surrounding dielectric. Because the device self-centers, less alignment tolerance need be provided between the bonding pad on the die and the lead to be attached thereto. Thus, the connecting lead portion may be made larger as compared to non-self-centering arrangements. This permits a comparatively large amount of high conductivity metal (e.g., the copper connecting lead) to be in close proximity with the contact pad and good solder filling of the pad-lead contact region, without allowing solder flow onto the adjacent dielectric on the chip. This combination improves the surge resistance without increasing the probability of die shorts due to solder creep. Having thus described the invention it will be apparent to those of skill in the art","textAfterTable":"US8981572 Sep 4, 2013 Mar 17, 2015 Amkor Technology, Inc.

(Internet Protocol) is a protocol which is typically used in conjunction with TCP (Transport Control Protocol) as a protocol suite for passing data from applications to networks and then from the networks to other applications. The IP portion of the protocol suite is used in transporting packets from the transmitting device to the receiving device. IP addresses are, of course, the means by which the packets are directed to the target device. Because IP addresses are well-known in the data-processing arts, they will not be explained in further detail here. It is sufficient to note that IP addressing allows data to be directed to devices which are not part of a predetermined, hard-wired design. “Object terminology,?? as used in this disclosure, refers to software language which handles devices in an object-oriented manner. That is, the devices and their functions can be used in a manner which is not dependent upon the specific implementation of the device, but instead upon the type and functions of the device. For instance, as will be explained below in regard to Jini software, a device which joins a network may register its services with a lookup server so that other devices which need these services can request them without regard to the specific device that provides them. In contrast, prior art on-board diagnostic buses have specific, predetermined devices which provide specific, predetermined services and which transmit/receive data over a specific, predetermined path. By using IP addressing and object terminology to provide communication between devices on the network, the invention eliminates the constraints which are inherent in bus systems. (Communication, as used here, includes data transfer and any other interaction between the devices.) For the purposes of this disclosure, a network is distinct from the various buses which may monitor the functions of an automobile and provide diagnostic information, but which can be coupled only to specific monitoring devices. These buses may be referred to as “on-board diagnostic?? (OBD) systems. Because the Environmental Protection Agency has adopted standards for such systems from the standards of the society of automotive engineers (SAE), most of the diagnostic buses use command sets and protocols defined by SAE standards (e.g. SAE J2979 and SAE J. 2850 VPW/PWM.) OBD systems do not provide IP addressability. Consequently, they do not, in the absence of the invention, support the wide variety of devices that can be coupled to a network. The utility of OBD system buses is limited to specific diagnostic functions which are designed into the automobile. It is contemplated, however, that embodiments of the invention may be implemented by adding an IP layer on top of the OBD buses. Thus, while the proprietary buses are distinct from the networks described herein, these buses may be converted to network uses, or they may be coupled to the networks through appropriate interfaces (i.e., the buses themselves can function as devices on the networks.)}","textBeforeTable":"Patent Citations In another scenario, a service station may have a wireless LAN so that a vehicle equipped with a network and wireless communication device can establish a connection with the LAN as the vehicle pulls into the station. Once the connection is established, the in-car sub-network and LAN can function as a single network. The service station may be configured to request the service records of the vehicle so that any necessary service may be performed. If a software maintenance update is required by one of the components in the vehicle, a server on the LAN may automatically download this information to the appropriate component. Alternately, the user of the vehicle may request information or services. For example, the user may request that music (e.g., in MP3 format) or videos (e.g., in MPEG-2 format) be downloaded for the passengers\u0027 entertainment. The user may also have information he or she wishes to have printed, in which case the information could be transmitted to a printer on the service station\u0027s LAN, where it could be picked up by the user. The operation of the in-car sub-network as a component in an external network can be illustrated in several examples. In one scenario, an automobile having an in-car sub-network is driven to a particular city. In the city, a LAN or MAN (metropolitan area network) is set up to establish a wireless connection to a communication device such as a","textAfterTable":"US8560609 Feb 7, 2011 Oct 15, 2013 Paxgrid Telemetric Systems, Inc Automotive telemetry protocol US8566732 * Aug 4, 2006 Oct 22, 2013 Apple Inc.

load register 1724 for the partition switch time-out watchdog timer 1716 specifies the time interval in fixed units, such as CPU clock ticks. Setting the load register 1724 does not modify or suspend timer operation. When the timer 1716 is activated, the timer 1716 is set with a value in load register 1724 and begins running. The partition switch time-out watchdog timer 1716 is enabled when the load register 1724 is loaded with a nonzero time-out interval value. The watchdog timer 1716 is disabled by clearing the load register 1724., 143116\u003dThe user mode SuperMain program 1614 then executes. It loads some additional JAVA utility classes in steps 1616 and 1618 and finally executes the main program of the application in step 1620., 157588\u003dThe PMU 1700 also maintains the status of each partition to identify any faults or time-outs that have occurred. The partition scheduling software is responsible for setting up for the next partition to activate including verifying the health of the partition before activation. The active partition ID is maintained by a single partition register 1746. An update to the partition register 1746 constitutes a partition switch. In protected mode (U/Pf line state\u003d1), the partition register 1746 identifies the active partition. In unprotected mode (U/Pf line state\u003d0), the partition register 1746 is zero to designate JVM0 operation. Note that the partition register 1746 can only toggle between zero and a non-zero partition ID., 164481\u003dThe piano roll is implemented by three fields in the ECB: the PRIndex (1112, FIG. 11), the LastChord field 1114, and the FirstChord field 1116. These three fields are all byte addresses of piano roll chords which can be located in memory. The fields are positioned in the ECB according to the order in which they are read. When a tick occurs, the chord indicated by the PRIndex field 1112 is ORed with RqMask field 1108 to activate the priority levels associated with set bits in the chord. The PRIndex field 1112 is then compared to the LastChord field 1114. If the fields are equal the PRIndex field 1112 is reset to the value of the FirstChord field 1116. Otherwise, the PRIndex field 1112 is advanced to the next chord. As previously mentioned, only JEM priority levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 are used for periodic threads, so other bits in the chords are always set to zero., 142522\u003dThe JVM then enters executive mode and executes the boot SuperMain program. The boot SuperMain program 1606 loads and initializes various JAVA shared classes including java/util/Properties.\u003cclinit\u003e class (step 1608), the java/lang/Integer.\u003cclinit\u003e class (step 1610) and other shared JAVA classes. Finally, the first bytecode for the java/lang/JEM_Thread.multiJVMmain program is loaded in step 1612 and executed. At this point, the user mode process stack has been created and the first byte code of the user SuperMain program fetched., 155875\u003dThe memory access time-out watchdog timer 1736 is activated by the start of a memory transaction. Once activated, the timer runs until either it is canceled, via a transfer acknowledge indicating that the memory transaction is complete, or its time-out interval has elapsed. While the timer is running, the PMU 1700 monitors the transfer acknowledge line 1756 to determine if the memory controller (not shown in FIG. 17) has responded to the transfer request. If a transfer acknowledge is detected before the time-out interval has elapsed, the timer 1736 is deactivated and processing continues in the normal fashion. Otherwise, when the time-out interval has elapsed, the memory access time-out watchdog timer alarm 1738 is generated, a transfer acknowledge is signaled to the processing element 1750 and the timer 1736 is deactivated. In addition, the memory access time-out event is recorded in the current partition status register 1742 and all data lines are zeroed in the event a read transaction was unterminated., 130961\u003dThe partition management unit (PMU) 1202 contains hardware (discussed in connection with FIG. 17, below) which enforces memory isolation between JVMs and forces the appropriate context switches to prevent the system from being “hung?? in one state. In order to ensure that time critical PMU functions will be met, some of the PMU functions can be added to the processor core processing. Additional interrupt management features can also be added to existing core interrupt controllers., 128301\u003dThe scheduling of the partition time “slices?? is schematically shown in FIG. 12. The JEM processor 1200 interacts with an IOC controller 1210 to manage input and output information as indicated schematically by arrow 1206. Controller 1210 includes a buffer 1212 for communicating with I/O channels 1214. Also included is a DMA unit 1208 which can communicate with a section of a dual port RAM assigned to each of the partitions 1218, 1224, 1230, 1236, 1242 and 1248. I/O controller 1210 handles all interrupts and shuttles I/O data to a dual port RAM section by means of DMA unit 1208. It is also possible that the dual port RAM units could host interpartition mailboxes., 118228\u003d4. PRIndex field 1112 is a pointer to the current piano roll chord., 135001\u003dPartitions are defined by non-maskable partition interrupts. Each partition interrupt terminates JVM processing in a partition and generates “interstitial?? activity. The interstitial activity is shown in detail in FIG. 14 which indicates time slices in a time line in which time increases to the right. FIG. 14 particularly illustrates interstitial processing which occurs after processing stops in JVM 1 and before processing begins in JVM2. During time interval 1400, user activity in JVM1 occurs. This processing is completing at the time immediately before the partition end as shown schematically area 1402., 114574\u003d8. The HCB_Ptr field 1020 which is a 32-bit field that contains a pointer which locates a heap control block for this thread., 158760\u003dA partition is activated when the partition register 1746 is loaded with a non-zero partition ID. During JVM0 operation (unprotected mode), the partition load register 1748 is set with the next partition to be activated. The partition register 1746 is set during the activation of a partition (specifically, during processing of the resumeJVM instruction) via the protected mode signal (U/Pf line state\u003d0) from the processor 1750. Proper setup of a partition activation sequence requires that the partition ID (partition load register value) is consistent with partition\u0027s JVM pointer (argument to resumeJVM instruction). Setting the partition load register 1746 to zero is allowed but meaningless since the processor 1750 remains in JVM0 operation (unprotected mode)., 161863\u003dPeriodic threads are scheduled with a piano roll mechanism which is implemented by means of the ready queue. As previously mentioned, the ready queue is managed by means of a bit mask (1152, FIG. 11B) which determines the priority queues that are enabled. A second mask is ORed with the bit mask in order to set several bits in the bit mask and enable several queues in parallel. Therefore, the second mask defines the “chord?? of the piano roll., 133768\u003dEach JVM also has a thread management control block or executive control block (ECB) 1310 which is used during context switches as described above. The ECB is located in the executive process stack 1308 directly above the User TCB pointer 1322 which is at the Exec_TOS pointer 1318 location in the EET 1302., 156971\u003dA load register 1740 is provided for the memory access time-out watchdog timer 1736 and specifies the time interval in fixed units, such as CPU clock ticks. Setting the load register 1740 does not modify or suspend timer operation. When the timer 1736 is activated, the timer 1736 is set with load register value and begins running. The memory access time-out watchdog timer 1736 is enabled when the load register 1740 is loaded with a nonzero time-out interval. The watchdog timer 1736 is disabled by clearing the load register 1738., 168192\u003dFIG. 20 illustrates an illustrative embodiment in which each JVM has its own piano roll sequence. In order to avoid having to use a separate interrupt to drive each JVM piano roll, the piano roll sequence in JVM0 is used to generate an activation signal which is sent to each JVM. The JVM0 piano roll is represented by chord mask array 2000 which is similar to that array illustrated, for example, in FIG. 19. This array is arranged so that every fifth chord generates an activation signal that causes a chord to be played in the piano roll of another JVM. For example chord 5 in the JVM0 piano roll 2000 causes a signal to be generated (as indicated by arrow 2004) which “plays?? the first chord in piano roll 2002 for JVM′ (any other JVM except JVM0.) Similarly, chord 10 in the JVM0 piano roll 2000 causes a signal to be generated (as indicated by arrow 2006) which “plays?? the second chord in piano roll 2002 for JVM′. Subsequent chords in the JVM0 piano roll play the next chord in the piano roll 2002 as indicated by arrows 2008 and 2010. Operation continues in this “modulo?? fashion throughout the JVM0 piano roll. The “modulo?? values used to trigger each JVM′ piano roll can be made different for each different JVM′ by recalculating the “modulo?? value during the processing for each JVM0 chord., 166679\u003dHowever, before setting bits in the RqMask 1108, a check is made to see if bits to be set are already set in RqMask 1108. Set bits mean that one or more threads at the corresponding priority levels are still present in the ready queue from a prior activation. In other words, the threads in question have not completed their periodic processing loops. If so, a cycle “slip?? has occurred and the cycle slip mask, CsMask 1118, is updated. The CsMask field 1118 indicates that the threads at a given priority level have slipped at least once. The CsMask field 1118 allows cycle slips to be monitored in real-time to ensure that a system is running as expected. In order to detect cycle slip, the current piano roll chord is simply ANDed with RqMask 1108 before being ORed with RqMask 1108., 117432\u003d2. PrMask field 1110 is a bit mask which masks out empty periodic priority queues in the ready queue. The PrMask bit mask field is normally equal to the RqMask bit mask field. However, if all threads at a periodic priority level should become blocked, the PrMask bit corresponding to that level is cleared. The PrMask field can be logically ANDed with a field representing a piano roll chord. If this logical operation is performed before the chord is ORed with the RqMask field, it prevents turning on empty periodic priority levels. The piano roll operation is described in detail below., 117297\u003d1. USER_TCB_PTR 1106 which is a 32-bit pointer which locates the currently-active user Thread Control Block., 160739\u003dAs previously described, the timer alarms and memory access violation signals are connected to the processor interrupt and ABORT inputs, 1751 and 1752, respectively.) The CPU ABORT processing proceeds as follows:, 160599\u003dA memory access error address register 1760 stores the address at which the first memory access violation occurs., 137884\u003dIn time period 1412, the resumeJVM instruction microcode executes in order to prepare the JVM2 microcode. Specifically, the resumeJVM instruction microcode saves the state of the JVM2 proxy thread and switches context to the JVM thread for which it is responsible. The actual JVM context switch setup depends on the “mode?? field. the resumeJVM code then pushes event flags for the JVM2 NMI handler onto the stack and fetches the first byte code for the JVM2 thread execution., 122603\u003dThe bit mask 1152 is sized so that there is a one-to-one mapping from each bit to each entry in the pointer array. Priorities are mapped into the pointer array so that the highest priority level resides at array index 0 and the leading (starting at the MSB of the mask 1152) zero count identifies the highest priority queue. With the bit mask/pointer array approach, the many queue manipulation operations are constant-time and fast, including dispatch of highest priority ready thread, queue insertion before/after the queue head, queue head deletion, queue insertion after the queue tail, queue “head-becomes-tail?? rotations and queue deletions., 162875\u003dA simple OR operation with a fixed chord mask would activate each periodic thread at the same rate each time a piano roll was played. In order to accommodate thread activation at varying rates, an array of chords is created and the periodic tick interrupt handler reads the masks from the array in a round-robin fashion in order to create a time-varying chord mask. Such a chord array is shown in FIG. 19. Each row in the array represents a chord used during the piano roll sequence. As shown in FIG. 19, there are N+1 chords in the array 1900 represented by N+1 rows (0-N). Each row contains a bit for each priority level indicating whether the associated priority level will be active during the piano roll. For example priority level 29 is active when every chord is played during the piano roll, while priority level 11 is active only on chords 2, 12, etc. The tick frequency which drives the piano roll is chosen based on the highest rate periodic thread; e.g., a 20 Hz thread needs a 10 Hz tick. However, if the slowest rate periodic thread frequency is not evenly divisible into all other periodic thread frequencies, the tick frequency will have to be greater than the highest rate thread, which results in a throughput penalty. (Unless, of course, there is some other activity that has to be done at this higher tick rate.) For this reason, periodic thread frequencies are typically chose as multiples of one another. It is similarly advantageous to have the delay resolution be equal to the period of the highest rate periodic thread., 115116\u003d11. The Qprev field 1026 which is a 32-bit field containing a pointer that locates the previous thread control block in a circular thread queue. Qprev is null when the thread control block is in a lock waiters list. Qprev and Qnext provide a doubly linked, forward and backward, structure., 137273\u003dThe proxy thread for JVM2 executes in time period 1410 and prepares its associated JVM2 for execution. In particular, the proxy thread checks for events such as interrupts which are applicable to JVM2 for which the proxy thread is responsible. The proxy thread also sets event flags and places a pointer to the location of the JVM2 EET in the JVM register 1300. It also checks the “health?? of JVM2 and can issue a JVM reset if a problem occurs. If everything appears to be in proper order, the proxy thread executes a “resumeJVM?? instruction., 119047\u003d9. SleepQ field 1128 is a pointer to a doubly-linked list of thread control blocks for threads delayed due to certain thread operations such as joins, waits, and sleeps., 113944\u003d4. The MARK field 1012 which is a 32-bit field that saves the pointer to the current stack mark of a suspended thread. This field is null prior to thread initialization., 140275\u003dThe processor next enters executive mode and proceeds to JAVA initialization. When the SuperMain program is executed, it loads and initializes the JAVA shared classes and executes the executive mode “main?? program. In particular, the SuperMain program 1512, loads the JAVA shared classes, such as java/util/Properties.\u003cclinit\u003e class 1514, the java/lang/integer.\u003cclinit\u003e class 1516 and other JAVA shared classes. Finally, the executive main program java/lang/JEM_Thread.multiJVMmainprogram 1518 is executed. The SuperMain program 1512 also initializes the PMU 1202 (FIG. 12) and initializes the I/O controller 1210. At this point, the user mode process stack has been created and the first byte code of the user SuperMain program fetched., 136290\u003dDuring time period 1406, the JVM0 NMI handler processes the interrupt. This processing involves updating the system tick which drives the JVM0 periodic thread mechanism (a piano roll mechanism is used as described below). The JVM0 piano roll selects the ID of the JVM to execute in the next partition. The JVM0 NMI handler also performs “mod?? calculations which drive the piano roll mechanism in each of the other JVMs as discussed below. At the end of the JVM0 NMI handler routine, the “outer?? procedure return microcode executes in time period 1408. This return microcode causes a dispatch of a “proxy thread?? for JVM2., 112852\u003dFIG. 10 shows the contents of a TCB 1000 needed for microcoded context switching. TCBs are constructed to look like a JAVA object so that the fields can be easily manipulated by the existing JAVA software. The TCB fields include the usual OBJ_CSA_Ptr and OBJ_LCB_Ptr fields, 1002 and 1004, respectively, which point to the CSA area and lock control blocks and also include the following fields:, 134494\u003dIn accordance with the principles of the invention, all of the control structures are located by the value in the JVM register 1300. Therefore, during a context switch, a new set of control structures can be made active simply by changing the value in the JVM register 1300. The same microcode and code sequences can be used for processing in each JVM by referencing the JVM register 1300 to obtain the “root?? address for the correct control structures for that JVM., 118733\u003d8. an RqPtrArray comprised of fields Rq0Ptr 1124 through Rq32Ptr 1126 is used as the “ready queue??. It is organized as an array of doubly-linked TCB lists, where each array element corresponds to a priority level. The individual lists are known as “priority queues??., 141093\u003dThe processor then enters user mode and executes the user SuperMain program 1510. The user SuperMain program 1510 loads and initializes additional JVM classes and finally executes the application main procedure. It also creates proxy threads and creates the application threads necessary to operate the application. In particular, the user supermain program 1510 loads the JEM/CharadePrintStream.\u003cclinit\u003e class1522, the JEM/JemUart.\u003cclinit\u003e class 1524 and other utility classes. Finally, the SuperMain program 1510 fetches the application main program 1526. It completes the power up initialization and begins execution of the user application program., 114726\u003d9. The Free SCK field 1022 which is a 32-bit field which contains a pointer that locates a linked list of free stack chunks. This field is null for an empty list of SCKs., 154038\u003dWhile the timer 1726 is running, the PMU 1700 monitors the E/U line 1754 to determine if the processing element 1750 has completed the partition interval timer interrupt (NMI) processing and transitioned to partition proxy thread. If the transition to user mode (E/Uf line state\u003d0) is detected before the time-out interval has elapsed, the timer is deactivated and processing proceeds in the normal fashion. Otherwise, when the time-out interval has elapsed, the kernel service time-out watchdog timer alarm (1814) is generated and the timer 1726 is deactivated. In addition, the kernel service time-out event 1814 is recorded in the current partition status register 1742 (for partition 0)., 113507\u003d2. The CSA field 1008 which is a 32-bit field that saves the class CSA pointer of a suspended thread or contains the CSA pointer for the class of a thread\u0027s main method prior to initialization of the thread., 159985\u003dA set of partition status registers 1742-1744 is defined for each partition. At a minimum, the register sets must consist of a bit mapped event register and a memory access error address register. The register sets 1742-1744 can either be cleared upon reset or cleared by the initialization software. The event bits in registers 1742-1744 are set by watchdog timer time-outs or memory access violations as previously described. The partition register 1746 identifies which of partition status registers 1742-1744 records the event., 129104\u003dIn FIG. 12, the partitions are arranged on a time line in which time increases in the direction shown by arrow 1216. Each partition is represented by a box 1218, 1224, 1230, 1236, 1242 and 1248 whose width represents the interval of time during which the associated JVM can operate. Although all of the partition widths (and corresponding time intervals) are shown as equal, the time duration of the partitions can be of different lengths, however the time duration of each partition is fixed at system initialization., 167534\u003dThe PrMask field 1110 complicates cycle slip detection. If a periodic priority level is empty when its tick occurs, it has slipped. However, since the RqMask bit won\u0027t be set, ANDing the chord with RqMask won\u0027t detect cycle slip that is due to periodic thread blockage. Instead, the chord must be XORed with the PrMask field 1110 to see which levels are marked as empty. This result must then be ORed with the “chord AND RqMask?? result. The CsMask field 1118 value is then calculated by ORing the CsMask value with the AND of the chord and RqMask value and ORing the result with the chord and XOR of the PrMask value., 113287\u003d1. PC field 1006 which is a 32-bit field that saves the program counter of a suspended thread or contains the MethodBlk pointer for a thread\u0027s main method prior to initialization of the thread., 148917\u003dIn order to provide deterministic time partitioning, timer 1712 must operate for the exact time interval and reset for the next time interval without losing any timer ticks. Hence, timer 1712 must run continuously and have the next time interval ready to be loaded when the timer alarm 1714 is signaled. Therefore, timer 1712 is only loaded via a load register 1714 which specifies the time interval for the next partition time slice. Load register 1714 specifies the time interval in fixed units, such as CPU clock ticks. Setting the load register 1714 does not modify or suspend timer operation. When the time interval has elapsed, an alarm signal is generated on output 1714 and the timer 1712 is reset with a value stored in load register 1714. The partition interval timer 1712 is enabled when the load register 1714 is loaded with a nonzero time interval value and the timer 1712 is disabled by clearing the load register 1714., 155426\u003dA memory access time-out watchdog timer 1736 is used to unconditionally complete an unterminated memory transaction. This watchdog guarantees all memory transactions are completed within a maximum response time and the processor clock is never suspended indefinitely. the timer alarm signal 1738 is connected to the ABORT input 1752 of the processing element 1750 as configured at initialization time., 118435\u003d6. FirstChord field 1116 is a pointer which points to the first chord in the piano roll., 118322\u003d5. LastChord field 1114 is a pointer which points to the last chord in the piano roll., 114398\u003d7. The JVM_Ptr field 1018 which is a 32-bit field that contains a pointer which locates a JVM Control Block for the JVM that this thread executes in., 141826\u003dEach JVM (other than JVM0) also has a reset vector which provides for initialization of the JVM. FIG. 16 illustrates the steps in initializing a JVM other than JVM0. As shown in FIG. 16, the microcode which implements the “resumeJVM?? instruction pushes parameters into the stack as indicated in step 1600 and resets the outer frame of the resumeJVM instruction as indicated in step 1602. The initialization routine then executes the first bytecode of the executive boot SuperMain program as indicated in step 1604. At this point, the executive mode process stack has been created and the first bytecode of the boot SuperMain program fetched., 133005\u003dA JVM register 1300 in the processor register file (204) contains the address of the EET 1302 for the active JVM. Each JVM also has its own set of EET handlers. Each JVM has an executive thread control block 1304 and an executive process stack 1308. The executive control block 1304 is located by a pointer, Exec_TCB 1316 in the EET 1302. The executive stack 1308 is located by the Exec_TOS pointer 1318 in the EET 1302. The EET 1302 also contains pointers to various interrupt, RESET and ABORT handlers. A pointer 1320, JCB_Ptr, to the JVM control block (JCB) 1306 is also included. The JCB includes event flags, validity and error information., 153136\u003dAnother watchdog timer, called the kernel service time-out watchdog timer 1726 is used to unconditionally terminate the partition interval timer interrupt handler when a partition proxy thread fails to be activated. This watchdog timer 1726 provides bounded execution of kernel services and guarantees partition time slice allocation. The timer alarm signal 1728 is also connected to the ABORT or RESET input 1752 of the processing element 1750 as configured at initialization time. The kernel service time-out watchdog timer 1726 is activated by the alarm signal from the partition interval timer 1712 as indicated by arrow 1730. Once activated, the timer 1726 runs until either it is canceled via the transition to user mode (E/Uf line state\u003d0 as indicated by arrow 1732), or its time-out interval has elapsed., 129691\u003dIn FIG. 12, three JVMs, designated as JVM0, JVM1 and JVM2 operate in a repeating sequence under control of processor 1200 as indicated by arrow 1204. When each partition ends a context switch occurs in order to start the JVM for the next partition. However, the operation of one JVM, for example JVM1 does immediately follow the operation of the preceding JVM. Instead there are time gaps between the partitions. These “gaps?? between the partitions are called “interstices?? of which interstices 1222, 1228, 1234, 1240 and 1246 are shown. During each interstice time slice, only JVM0 operates and acts to service interrupts and schedule the next JVM for execution. Consequently, two context switches occur at the end of each partition. A first context switch transfers control from the currently operating JVM to JVM0. The second context switch transfers control from JVM0 to the next scheduled JVM., 132390\u003dThe logical JEM executive execution environment consists of the executive entry table (EET) 1302, JVM control block (JCB) 1306, executive thread control block (ETCB) 1304, and an executive control block 1322. Each JVM has its own EET 1302 which serves as the root data structure for a JVM and contains pointers to the other relevant control structures. JVM0, the “master?? JVM, has an EET that resides at memory location 0000. The JEM architecture clears the JVM register on reset so that the system always starts at JVM0 during a reset operation., 115432\u003d12. Additional space 1028 is available for thread scheduling software., 114269\u003d6. The SKLM field 1016 which is a 32-bit field that saves the current stack limit pointer of a thread., 139802\u003dIn step 1506, an initialized data block (IDB) chain is traversed. Then, in step 1508, the outer frame for the reset vector is set up. Finally, in step 1510, the first byte code for the JVM0 SuperMain method is fetched and executed. Step 1510 completes the microcode initialization. At this point, the executive mode process stack has been created and the first byte code of the boot SuperMain program has been fetched., 154805\u003dA load register 1734 is provided for the kernel service time-out watchdog timer 1726 which specifies the time interval in fixed units, such as CPU clock ticks. Setting the load register 1734 does not modify or suspend timer operation. When the timer 1726 is activated, the timer 1726 is set with load register value and begins running. The kernel service time-out watchdog timer 1726 is enabled when the load register 1734 is loaded with a nonzero time-out interval. The watchdog timer 1726 is disabled by clearing the load register 1734., 114140\u003d5. The TOS field 1014 which is a 32-bit field that saves the current top-of-stack pointer of a thread., 139022\u003dIn order to handle a system reset or power up condition, the JVM register 1300 is cleared by a hardware reset and a reset EET resides at location 00000000. The reset microcode performs the steps shown in FIG. 15. In particular, FIG. 15 shows actions performed first by the reset microcode, and then by JVM0 operating first in executive mode and then in user mode. As indicated in FIG. 15, the power up and reset routine starts with a boot internal self test (BIST) step 1500 which performs a test of various components and consistency checks. Next, in step 1502, the microcode checks for the existence of a program RAM. Next, in step 1504, an optional microcode RAM is loaded if a writable control store is being used., 118550\u003d7. CsMask field 1118 is a bit mask which identifies periodic priority levels that have experienced one or more instances of “cycle slip?? as described below., 121030\u003dAs shown in FIG. 11B, the ready queue consists of the RqPtrArray 1150. In the ready queue 1150, each active priority level has its own doubly-linked list of TCBs, and a global variable is used to represent each list. For example, JEM priority level 21 contains a pointer T5TCB (1154) which points to a linked list starting with TCB T5 (1156). In this list there is only a single member 1156. Similarly, priority level 10 contains a pointer T3TCB (1158) which points to a TCB list containing three linked TCBs 1160, 1162 and 1164. The individual linked lists are known as “priority queues?? and the global variables (1154, 1158) reside in the ready queue 1150 which is effectively a pointer array. There are 32 JEM priority levels, running from 0 to 31. Empty priority levels, such as level 1166, have null pointers in the corresponding array entries. Queue insertion is accomplished in constant time, since the thread priority may be used as an index into the pointer array. Thread dispatch requires a linear search through the pointer array which is facilitated by the bit mask field 1152. The bit mask 1152 maps directly to the linked list pointer array with one bit for each level. The highest occupied priority level can be located by finding the first set bit (i.e., counting the leading zeros) in the bit mask 1152. As shown in FIG. 11B, this level 1168 corresponds to priority level 21., 119243\u003d10. Additional space 1130 is available for thread scheduling software., 165543\u003dAlso, as mentioned, a periodic priority queue may be empty when a chord mask containing a bit which would activate the queue is “played??. Since activation of an empty periodic level must be prevented, the PrMask field 1110 is used to clear the chord bits of empty levels before the chord is ORed with RqMask 1108. The PrMask field 1110 has a bit for each priority level. A PrMask bit is set when a thread is added to an associated empty priority level and cleared when the last thread is removed from the corresponding priority level. When there are no activated periodic priority queues the PrMask field 1110 is equal to the RqMask field 1108. When there are one or more periodic priority queues, the PrMask field 1110 normally differs from the RqMask field 1108 only at the periodic priority levels that have completed their cyclic processing and are awaiting their next activation via the piano roll. The bits in the RqMask field 1108 are set by ORing the RqMask field 1108 with the result of ANDing the chord mask with the value in the PrMask field., 135668\u003dAt time 1401, a partition interrupt, which is a non-maskable interrupt, occurs. The interrupt causes the JEM microcode in the processor to vector to an NMI interrupt handler. More specifically, during time period 1404, the microcode saves the current user or executive state and updates the JVM prior mode field 1328 in JCB 1306 (FIG. 13) since the partition could have been in user or executive mode when the partition interrupt occurred. Next, the microcode sets up the JVM0 executive mode and invokes the JVM0 NMI handler to process the partition interrupt., 158385\u003dA load register 1748 is provided for the partition register 1746 and specifies the next partition to be activated. Setting the load register 1748 does not immediately modify the partition register 1746. The partition register 1746 is set with load register value during the transition from unprotected to protected mode., 113741\u003d3. The VARS field 1010 which is a 32-bit field that saves the pointer to the current local environment of a suspended thread. This field is null prior to thread initialization., 162335\u003dPeriodic processing is performed as part of an endless loop. When periodic processing is complete, a call to a runtime method blocks a thread by clearing its bit in the ready queue mask 1108. Once removed from the ready queue, the periodic thread remains blocked until the bit mask 1108 is ORed with the chord to once again set the thread\u0027s ready queue bit in the bit mask 1108 and prepare the chord for “playing.?? This logical OR operation is performed as part of a periodic tick interrupt handler., 150815\u003dA partition switch time-out watchdog timer 1716 is used to unconditionally terminate partition execution when the partition interval timer interrupt (1804) is not acknowledged by the processing element 1750. This abnormal condition could be the result of a non-terminating instruction or an endless microcode loop. The timer alarm signal 1718 can be connected to the ABORT input 1752 of the processing element 1750 as configured at initialization time. The partition switch time-out watchdog timer 1718 is activated by the alarm signal from the partition interval timer1712 as indicated by arrow 1720. Once activated, the timer 1716 runs until either it is canceled via a transition to unprotected mode (U/Pf line state becomes 1) or the time-out interval has elapsed., 120219\u003dIn the inventive JEM processor, a priority-based scheduler which conforms to the above-described rules dispatches (makes ready to execute) the highest priority thread from the set of all runnable, or “ready??, threads. In a real-time embedded system, this choice should be made quickly, so the data structure used to represent all ready threads should facilitate fast lookup of the highest priority thread. A data structure called a “ready?? queue is used to store ready threads. The threads in the ready queue are represented by thread control blocks. A thread is “in?? the ready queue if the ready queue contains that thread\u0027s TCB. The ready queue implemented with fields 1124-1126 is a 32 priority level queue which uses a bit mask (field 1108) to speed thread dispatch., 118048\u003d3. RqMask field 1108 which is a bit mask that identifies occupied ready queue priority levels. It aids rapid lookup of the highest priority ready thread., 148505\u003dThe partition interval timer 1712 is used to signal the completion of a partition time slice and return to JVM0 operation, which, as previously mentioned, checks for system events and schedules the next partition. The timer alarm signal is connected to the NonMaskable Interrupt (NMI) input 1714 of the processing element 1750 as configured at initialization time., 134130\u003dThe User TCB pointer 1322 points to the User TCB 1312 which is also used during context switches as discussed above. The User TCB contains a pointer 1324 (TOS) which points to the top of the User process stack 1314 and another pointer 1326 (SKLM) which points to the end of the User process stack 1314., 149968\u003dFIGS. 18A and 18B illustrate the various timeout signals which will be periodically generated during a normal partition time slice. The partition interval timer generates the partition interrupts 1804 (illustrated in FIG. 18A and 18B) and 1808 (FIG. 18A.) After each partition interrupt 1804, there is a kernel service overhead time period 1802. This kernel service overhead time period 1802 is illustrated in more detail in FIG. 18B. It is followed by a partition time period 1800 during which the partition specific threads run. The partition time slice 1800 includes a proxy thread overhead time period 1805 during which a proxy thread runs as described above and a protected mode execution time period during which the JVM thread (other than JVM0) runs., 114923\u003d10. The Qnext field 1024 which is a 32-bit field containing a pointer that locates the next thread control block in a circular thread queue or in a lock waiters list., 151673\u003dWhile the timer is running, the PMU 1700 monitors the unprotected/protected line 1754 as indicated by arrow 1722 to determine if the processing element 1750 has acknowledged the partition interval timer interrupt (1804) and begun a transition to JVM0 operation. If the transition to unprotected mode (U/Pf line state\u003d1) is detected before the time-out interval of timer 1716 has elapsed, the timer 1716 is deactivated and execution proceeds in a normal fashion. Otherwise, when the time-out interval has elapsed, the partition switch time-out watchdog timer alarm 1812 is generated and the timer 1716 is deactivated. In addition, the partition switch time-out event 1812 is recorded in the current partition status register 1742., 159604\u003dA partition is deactivated when the partition register 1746 is cleared. In protected mode, the partition register 1746 is cleared during the response to the partition switch interrupt via the protected mode signal from the processor (U/Pf line state\u003d1). The partition register 1746 is also cleared upon reset since JVM0 is in effect., 138414\u003dEach JVM has an NMI handler which handles interrupts. This NMI handler executes in time interval 1414 and checks event flags, and, depending on the set flags (if any) an appropriate JVM interrupt handler is invoked. This handler uses the IRQ_Array in the corresponding EET 1302. At the end of the JVM2 NMI handler routine, the “outer?? procedure return microcode executes in time period 1416. This return microcode causes a dispatch of the JVM2 thread which executes in time period 1418. Execution continues in this manner for each context switch.}","textBeforeTable":"Citas de patentes The description above should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, but as merely providing an illustration to some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention.

de brevets After a number of plasma processing runs, the shield and inserts can likewise be easily removed and discarded. Any negative impact of the plasma process upon the hardware of the chamber interior is borne by the relatively inexpensive shield and its associated components, which can be quickly cleaned outside the chamber or changed, to restore operation with little expense and downtime. One important advantage of the shield 38 of the present invention is that it is easy to install. As we have seen, the construction of the shield allows the area embraced by the shield to be compressed sufficiently to allow the shield to be easily passed through the opening at the top of the chamber, even when that opening is slightly smaller in diameter than the interior walls 10. Once the shield 38 is received in the chamber, it is positioned to align the shield 38 to the window 18 and slit valve apertures 20 in the chamber with the window 44 and slit valve 42 openings in the shield 38. Sleeves 64 and 62 of the inserts 54 and 52 are then fitted into the window and slit valve openings, so that the inserts 54 and 52 are press contacted within the window 44 and slit valve openings 42 of the shield and are also contacted with the shield 38.
